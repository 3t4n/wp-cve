= How to enable Webyx FE in Elementor =

1. Create a new page in WordPress.
2. In pages attributes find the Template select and choose *Webyx FE*.
	**NOTE:** if you select the *webyx FE* template through the Elementor general settings page, you will need to refresh the editor page to display webyx template correctly.
3. Edit the page with Elementor.
4. Click on Settings button. You will see Webyx tab.
5. Go to WEBYX FE tab.
6. Toggle *Enable Webyx* option.
7. Click on Apply Changes.
8. Wait for the page preview to refresh. 

**NOTE:** toggling the "Enable Webyx" option in *SECTION GENERAL OPTIONS* you can disable the work done with Webyx and go back to the classic mode of Elementor sections on the fly, without losing what has been previously done.
**IMPORTANT:** The PRO version, if installed, disables the normal loading of the FREE version, so you can keep only one of the two versions active at a time.

= WEBYX FE SECTIONS/CONTAINERS =

Webyx for Elementor allows you to wrap Elementor sections/containers into Webyx sections/containers. 
Webyx sections/containers are wrappers that incorporate the original Elementor sections/containers and contain specific attributes and/or webyx settings.
To be able to carry out this transformation, enable the "Enable Webyx Section/Containers" toggle: in this way the Elementor source section/containers will be displayed in the editor in full screen mode
and the original light blue Elementor overlay border will be shown in purple colour.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** for Webyx to function properly, you must keep the root element active.
In particular, pay attention if you are using Containers: those nested inside the root element MUST necessarily have this option deactivated, otherwise the system will not work correctly.
From now on we will use the term Section for both Sections and Containers ([IMPORTANT NOTES FOR ELEMENTOR CONTAINERS](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/working-on-compatibility-with-elementor-flexbox-containers/#post-16696168)).

**NOTE:** Webyx FE sections/containers are containers that can have any type of content.

To create the full screen flow of contents you can use the 2 types of sections provided by Webyx:

1. Front Sections (or Containers)
2. Side Sections (or Containers)

**Front Sections**

A Front Section appears as the leader of a strip of sections.
Remember that the height of the section will automatically extended to the height of the inserted content inside the Elementor's visual editor preview.
While in the actual website if the content exceeds the viewport you can view it by enabling the "scrollable content" option.

**IMPORTANT:** the very first section of your website **MUST** be a Front Section.

**Side Sections**

Side Sections will be placed laterally and immediately following their respective leaders on the website, while inside the visual editor they will be presented one below the other vertically following their order.

= Webyx FE Settings =

To customize general plugin settings just go to Settings > Webyx FE Settings.
 
* **Hide WP admin top bar**: hide WP admin top bar in Webyx pages preview.
* **Enable Webyx menu**: enable Webyx menu "Display location" in Appearance/Menus/Menu structure/Menu settings.

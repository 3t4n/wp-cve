Adds quick links in the WordPress admin bar for users of Bricks theme.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a handy "Bricks" menu item in the WP admin bar for quickly navigating to various areas within the site as well as to external sites relevant for the users of Bricks Builder theme.

A very useful feature is being able to directly view the list of all Templates and Pages and edit any of them with Bricks directly with a single click without going to Templates and Pages list screens first.

The admin bar can also be enabled in Bricks editor pages via the plugin's settings page at Bricks â†’ Bricks Navigator.

Links to Bricks-specific plugins' settings page are also provided.

The menu can be simplified by disabling unwanted items in the plugin's settings page.

A "new tab" icon is provided for site-specific menu items added by the plugin to open that menu item in a new tab.

All external links open in a new tab.

Built for the Bricks community by [BricksLabs](https://brickslabs.com/).

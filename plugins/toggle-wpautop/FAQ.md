# Frequently Asked Questions #

## Can I disable wpautop completely with this plugin? ##

Right now, no. wpautop is a great filter, and in most cases you should not need it disabled globally. However, if there is enough demand for this feature we can add it.

## Can I set wpautop to default to "off" for new posts.

Yes.

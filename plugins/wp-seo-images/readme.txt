SEO image Manager, Improve google images ranking. 

== Description ==

We Adrenalina have implemented our first plugin: Wordpress Seo Images

As a result of Goggle Images' new functioning, where Goggle stores the sites' images, provoking a descent in the sites which come from Goggle Images.  
Kico from Interdigital suggested creating a plugin for Wordpress the function of which was to avoid the traffic loss in Goggle Images, to solve the problem, so we began to work on it.

Its workings are very simple: once you activate the plugin (located in the "settings" tab) we get a "SEO Images" option which will allow us to introduce the text for the water marking which will be added to the images which Goggle catches from our site.

== Installation ==

Setup is simple. Go to the "Settings" tab where you must add a line a for the water marking and the second step is to alter the file .htaccess to add the two lines which you'll find in the same "Settings" tab (see previous image). Mind you, these two lines must be added followed by the phrase "RewriteBase /" and online works with the Apache rewrite module on.

We hope that this SEO images plugin is helpful to you guys and that you can regain and increase the traffic coming from Goggle Images.

Stock Photos by Dreamstime: Easily search and insert images into your posts and pages from Dreamstime's vast database of Free and Royalty-Free stock photos & illustrations.

== Description ==

Insert stock photos & images easily & safely into your posts and pages from the largest selection of free images and professional stock photos online without leaving WordPress. The Dreamstime plugin enhances your WordPress workflow by allowing you to download royalty-free and public domain images directly from Dreamstime’s database of millions of free stock photos and commercial Royalty-Free images from within the WordPress Add Media tool. All images are model released and properly attributed so they are 100% safe to use without ever having to worry about model or photographer claims.

For current Dreamstime users, the plugin is linked to your existing account so if you’ve already purchased an image prior to installing the WordPress plugin, you won’t have to purchase the same image again. New users can quickly sign up a free account at Dreamstime.com.

Dreamstime contributors can add their own images to their blog articles without having to pay for them.

You can also make money with the automatic Dreamstime referral program integration. Using the automatically generated referral links you will receive 10% of all sales and uploads made within the first 3 years for each user you refer!

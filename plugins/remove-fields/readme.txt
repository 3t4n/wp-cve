Remove the website field from the comment form and also remove some other rarely used profile fields

== Description ==

Do you know why your posts are not getting any comments? It's probably because of the website input field in the comment form. 

My personal experience: **the number of comments increased dramatically after I removed that website field**.

In addition to removing the website field from the comments form, the plugin removes these fields from the profile page:

* Personal Options section (Visual Editor, Admin Color Scheme, Keyboard Shortcuts, Toolbar & Admin Language)
* About Yourself section (Biographical Info)

Once installed, all the fields & sections mentioned above will no longer be available to users.

== Installation ==

1. Put the plugin folder into [wordpress_dir]/wp-content/plugins/
2. Go into the WordPress admin interface and activate the plugin

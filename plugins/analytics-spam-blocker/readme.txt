== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =
Analytics Spam Blocker adds a list of domains to be blocked to your .htaccess file. This list is regularly updated next to what you add yourself so you'll be able to filter out the majority of referrer spam very quickly.

= Why do I need a subscription? =
You don't, older versions required a free subscribtion though. Update to version 3 or newer to see the new system.

= How does the list get updated? =
I've developed a unique reporting system where you can easily report suspicious domains. If the domain gets reported a few times by different people it will be included in the blocklist.

= Who manages the blocklist updates? =
In a way, you do. By reporting new domains. However the system is mostly automated after you send your report. The blocklist service is governed and provided by [Arnan de Gans](https://ajdg.solutions/?mtm_campaign=spamblocker).

= I need help with this plugin =

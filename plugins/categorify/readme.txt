⚡️ **Easy to use media library plugin for all WordPress websites. Organize your WordPress media library files using a drag and drop organizer**


= Features =

The plugin allows you to create virtual categories to organize your WordPress media file uploads. So when you move files and categories, that won’t break the permalinks to your images in the page/post content.

<strong>Note:</strong> adding a image into a category will not change its permalinks.

= So How Does it Work? =

It’s rather simple really – once you install the plugin, you can begin using it. If you’re a content creator, you can upload text, images, videos, and audio at the click of a button. Then you can organize everything you upload into neat categories. It has a drag and drop interface, making it user-friendly for everyone. It’s like having your own media library at your own disposal. You can create this media library for yourself or others – it’s perfect for website owners and content professionals!

== Description ==

Connect Surfer’s Content Editor to WordPress. Write and optimize your articles for SEO, find new keyword ideas, and publish straight to WordPress.

== SURFER’S OFFICIAL WORDPRESS PLUGIN ==
A free WordPress plugin that will connect your WordPress page to Surfer’s Content Editor. Surfer’s WP plugin just saved you a step (or 2!). Write, publish and start ranking.

== EASY SETUP AND FAST INTEGRATION ==

== AVOID FORMATTING ISSUES AND INCONSISTENCIES == 
CTRL + A, CTRL + C, CTRL + V, in two clicks! What you write in Surfer’s Content Editor is what you’ll get (and see) when you publish on WordPress.

Headings, images and text are converted block by block and transferred seamlessly from Surfer’s interface to your WordPress site.

Images are downloaded and stored on WordPress and are accessible in your media library versus an external link which improves performance and SEO!

Surfer’s Plugin currently supports the two most widely used WordPress text editors: Gutenberg and Classic Editor (and can distinguish between the two!).

V.1, V.2 V.3? **With Surfer plugin you always publish the current and correct version of your article without the copy-paste confusion.**

== OPTIMIZE AND IMPROVE EXISTING ARTICLES ==
Keep your content relevant and competitive with periodic updates to keep climbing the SERPs!

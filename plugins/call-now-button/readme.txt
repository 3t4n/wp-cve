The web's #1 click to call button for your website! A simple and powerful plugin that adds a Call Now Button to your website.

== Description ==

### What does the plugin do?

This plugin places a Call Now Button (click-to-call button) to the bottom of the screen. Because your mobile visitors already have a phone in their hands this plugin will allow them to call you with one simple touch of the button.
No more navigating to the contact page and no more complicated copy/pasting or memorizing the phone number!

#### More actions
Connect to our **cloud service** to enable more action buttons such as **WhatsApp**, **Signal**, **Telegram**, **Messenger**, **SMS/Text**, **Email**, **Directions**, **Skype**, **Viber**, **Zalo**, **WeChat**, **Line** and more. Find a more complete overview below in the _Account_ section.

###Could not be easier!
The settings are very easy: enable and enter your phone number. That's it!

The label allows you to add some text to your button. Leaving the label empty will show a nice circular phone button to your visitors (take a look at the screenshots).

#### Presentation controls
Under the **Presentation tab** you can change the colors of the button, move it to a different screen position and limit the pages on which the button should be visible.

#### Settings
In the **Settings menu** you'll find a bunch of features such as click tracking in Google Analytics, fire a conversion tag so a call is registered as a conversion in Google Ads, adjust the size of the button or move the button further backwards in case you want something else to sit on top of it (e.g. your privacy notice). Here you can also enable the connection to our _Cloud service_.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I enter my phone number? =

In the Settings section on your WordPress Dashboard you'll find a new addition: Call Now Button. Click on it to go to the plugin settings.

= Can I add text to the button? =

Yes, it is possible to add text to your button. You can chose to show the text inside the full width button across the bottom or top of the screen. It's also possible to add a text bubble next to the circular button. This works for all placements with the exception of the center button positions at the top an bottom of the screen.

= I don't see the button on my website. Why? =

First step is to check if the button is enabled - this is the first checkbox on the settings page.

Next thing is to make sure that your theme is responsive. Responsive means that the website adapts to the size of the screen it's being viewed on. Simply put, if you need to zoom in to be able to read the text of your website on your mobile phone, the plugin will not work.

Last thing to check is if you have a caching plugin installed. Caching plugins make your website faster by showing a copy of your website instead of the actual website. As a consequence you will not see the Call Now Button because the copy was made before the button was installed. To fix this, go to your cache plugin settings page and empty the cache (sometimes called flush the cache). After doing this you should see the button. Do the same thing each time you make changes to the button.

= I only see the button on some pages of my website

You have a caching plugin active on your website and the cached pages are showing an older version of your website. Delete/empty the cache and reload the pages.

Another option could be that you have set the Call Now Button to only appear on specific pages. Go into the Call Now Button settings, open the Presentation tab and check that the field next to Limit appearance is empty.

= Do I have to add a country code to my phone number? =

You don't have to, but we recommend that you do to increase your options internationally.

= Do I start the number with + or 00? =

In most countries you'll be fine using either but there are some exceptions. To be on the safe side we recommend using the plus sign.

= Can I change the appearance of the Call Now Button? =

Yes! You can easily change the color of the button and make it sit in any of the 8 preset locations across the screen of a phone. You also have the option to spread it out over the full bottom or top of the phone screen.

= I only want to show the button on a few pages. Is that possible?

Yes, you can enter the IDs of posts and pages you wish to include or exclude.

= I need way more flexibility! Isn't there a PRO version that I can use? =

Yes, you can connect the plugin to our cloud service NowButtons.com. That already enables a bunch of extras. From there you can easily upgrade to PRO. Scroll up to see what's included PRO. Or check out [NowButtons.com](https://nowbuttons.com/).

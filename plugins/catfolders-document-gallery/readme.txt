== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the WordPress pdf gallery plugin work? =
This free WordPress pdf gallery plugin adds a **CatFolders Document Gallery** block in Gutenberg. You can use it to create a WP document library on the front-end. Once you have published the documents and other files to the gallery, your website visitors can search, sort, preview, view all documents, or download files very quickly. It helps retain traffic and boost engagement on your WordPress website.

= Can't upload images or files to WordPress media library? =
No worries, these things happen. Please check out how to [troubleshoot WordPress media library not loading](https://wpmediafolders.com/troubleshoot-wp-media-library-not-loading/) or [upload documents to WordPress media library](https://wpmediafolders.com/how-to-create-wordpress-pdf-gallery/#upload-documents-to-word-press-media-library).

= Is there a limit to the number of documents I can display on WordPress page/post? =
There's no limit to how many attachments and files you can add to a folder. Therefore, no limit on the number of documents per page/post! This **CatFolders Document Gallery** plugin is optimized with smart pagination so the users can go back and forth between the pages very quickly without reloading page.

= Does it support hierarchical folders? =
If you're using [CatFolders - WP Media Folders free version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/catfolders/), which doesn't create subfolders, it won't be displaying multiple folders on the front-end. However, you can bulk-select folders using **Ctrl/Command** or **Shift** key and display all files contained in those folders.
Regarding showing the folder tree structure on the front-end, we are considering it and will implement it as soon as we can.

= Can the document gallery display PDF first pages as thumbnails? =
Yes, as long as your website's server is properly configured with ImageMagick and GhostScript, which generates the first page image of PDF in the WordPress media library, it will be displayed on the front-end accordingly.


= Can I request to add more features to this plugin? =
So you want us to add further integrations such as **Elementor pdf gallery**, and others? To put it into consideration, please submit your ideas to [CatFolders feature requests](https://feedbo.io/board/catfolders/).

The most advanced page and layout builder for Gutenberg and the new Block Editor, with columns, rows and responsive controls.

== Description ==

ðŸ‘‰ For more information about the plugin, visit the <a href="https://justevolve.it/grids/documentation/">documentation website</a>.

A layout builder is a tool that helps you creating visual structures in your page, from a simple layout made by adjacent columns, to more complex compositions. Grids is entirely based on the WordPress block editor, which means that you'll be able to use it together with the myriad of content blocks that developers and designers from all around the World are creating.

With Grids, we're bringing a visual structure to the content written with the WordPress Block Editor.

=== ðŸ‘‰ Sections & areas ===

A <strong>Section</strong> is a portion of the page that aims at being visually distinct from the rest of the content. Sections are usually top-level blocks that you add one after the other; the sequence of sections is what makes your page layout.

Each Section that you create is composed by several different <strong>Areas</strong>. In their most basic form, you can think of Areas as columns, which are nothing else than containers for content blocks.

For more elaborated compositions, the <strong>Grid Designer</strong> allows you to create exactly the grid structure you want within the boundaries of a Section, by using CSS Grid.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/grids` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Will it work on my theme too?**

YES! Whether your theme is free or premium, Grids will seamlessly integrate with it.

**Can I switch themes? Will I lose content in the process?**

Your content will NOT be lost when switching themes, regardless of the one you choose to use. Also, since the plugin doesn't rely on shortcodes, even deactivating the Grids plugin completely will leave you with perfectly readable content in your pages.

**How does support work?**

Support on the plugin page on WordPress.org is completely voluntary. Feel free to post bug reports, or questions about the plugin functionality.

POSSIBLY BREAKING CHANGES:

* In this version, we have removed the global page setting that allowed for the editor area to be wider when editing a page with the Block Editor. We feel that this should be better handled by the theme itself, especially if it supports the Full Site Editing mode.
* We have also removed the global page setting that determined the horizontal gutter between areas. This is now handled individually by Section blocks (look for Gap settings). As before, both horizontal and vertical gaps are subject to media queries.
* We have removed the <code>grids-s-$section_id</code> and <code>grids-a-$area_id</code> classes from their respective elements, since they were no longer needed to generate the element's style. If you need to specifically identify a section or area, you can use their custom class/anchor controls provided by the Block Editor.

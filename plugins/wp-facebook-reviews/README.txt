Use the official Facebook API to show off your review and recommendations in a slider or grid! A simple and easy way to display your Twitter and Facebook recommendations and ratings! Use your reviews to build customer confidence!

== Description ==

You work hard for your 5 star reviews, ratings, and positive recommendations on your Facebook page, now you can easily display them on your WordPress site! A great way to boost customer confidence with Social Proof from Facebook and Twitter!

This plugin uses the official Facebook and Twitter APIs unlike other similar plugins that use illegal crawling/scraping methods to download reviews. 

Here's a quick video demonstration of adding reviews in less than 2 minutes!

Allows you to display Facebook recommendations as 5 star reviews or you can show them as normal positive recommendations! A while ago Facebook made the decision to switch from a 1-5 rating scale to either Positive or Negative recommendations. There is a setting in the plugin that will allow you to save the recommendations with a rating value that way they can be displayed with 5 stars.

Updated to include Twitter! Along with Facebook reviews and recommendations, you can now search Twitter and download positive tweets to show off on your site! Create a Twitter slider that includes positive tweets about you!



How it Works:
1) Easily connect to our Facebook app with a couple of button clicks.
2) Click the Retrieve Reviews button to download all your Facebook reviews and ratings in to your WordPress Database.
3) Create a review template and then past the template shortcode in Post, Page, or text widget.

For Twitter:
1) Easily search for tweets mentioning your business or service.
2) Click the download icon next to the ones you want to save to your database.
3) Same as step 3 above.

Visitors to your site will love the social proof provided by this plugin!

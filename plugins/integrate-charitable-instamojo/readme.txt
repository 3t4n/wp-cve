== Description ==
Instamojo is a free Payment Gateway for 12,00,000+ Businesses in India. There is no setup or annual fee. Just pay a transaction fee of 2% + ₹3 for the transactions. Instamojo accepts Debit Cards, Credit Cards, Net Banking, UPI, Wallets, EMI, NEFT and IMPS

[Charitable](https://wordpress.org/plugins/charitable/) plugin of the Wordpress allows non-profits and developers to create powerful fundraising platforms on their own website.

This plugin will help you integrate Instamojo Payment Gateway with the Chartable Plugin without doing any efforts.

== Installation ==
Steps to Integrate Instamojo with Charitable Plugin

1. Install and Activate Charitable Plugin if not done already.
2. Install and Activate Charitable - Instamojo Payment Gateway Plugin. Go to the setting page of the plugin.
3. Some features may not work with old Instamojo account! We recommend you to create a new account. Sign up process will hardly take 10-15 minutes.
[Sign Up on Instamojo](http://go.thearrangers.xyz/instamojo?utm_source=charitable&utm_medium=ecommerce-module&utm_campaign=wordpress-store&utm_content=help-signup)
4. During signup, Instamojo will ask your PAN and Bank account details, after filling these details, you will reach Instamojo Dashboard.
5. On the left-hand side menu, you will see the option "API & Plugins" click on this button.
6. This plugin is based on Instamojo API v2.0, So it will not work with API Key and Auth Token. For this plugin to work, you will have to generate Client ID and Client Secret. On the bottom of "API & Plugins" page, you will see Generate Credentials / Create new Credentials button. Click on this button.
7. Now you will have to choose a platform from the drop-down menu. You can choose any of them, but I will recommend choosing option "WooCommerce/WordPress"
8. Copy "Client ID" & "Client Secret" and paste it in the Charitable Instamojo extension (Live Client ID and Live Client Secrect respectively)
9. Fill "Registered Email Address" field.
10. Save the settings and its done.

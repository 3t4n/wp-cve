== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need this if I am using Suffusion? =

Prior to version 4.4.8 of Suffusion, the theme had inbuilt shortcodes. If you have used those shortcodes on your website, then you
definitely need this plugin. As of version 4.4.8 of Suffusion, the shortcodes have been removed from the theme. This plugin now
stands alone and is fully featured, so you can use it by itself, regardless of which version of Suffusion you use, or whether
you use Suffusion at all.

= How do I make this work with other themes? =

Just activate the plugin, and you are done. Whether you have moved from Suffusion, or if you are starting anew, you are always covered.

Disable the default WordPress registration page without disabling user registration.

== Description ==

There are many situations where you would like to enable user registrations, but disable the default WordPress registration page. Particularly when using a membership or registration plugin that allows registration in the front end of your website. 

Unknown to many; the default WordPress registration stays active when installing these frontend registration plugins. This means that any anti-spam and security measures you implement on the frontend means nothing, because bots are still able to create spam accounts on your website using the backend or default WordPress registration page.

The "[Disable Registration Page](https://www.rizonesoft.com/wordpress/disable-wordpress-registration-page/)" plugin closes this dangerous backdoor without disabling user registration on your website.

== Description == 

= Responsive Portfolio Image Gallery =

Portfolio Gallery is a powerful, lightweight, filterable, and responsive image/photo gallery plugin. The aim is to showcase your images/photos in a much more professional way. Using WordPress Post Editor, you can create as many portfolios as you like. There is a powerful settings tool in the plugin. By using portfolio settings, you can select the portfolio categories of your choice, you can set the description length, the number of portfolios to show, hover and filter effect, and lots more...

The portfolio plugin represents image thumbnails using many CSS3 hover and filter effects. By clicking on a thumbnail, it will expand a preview box and display a larger image of that thumbnail. Also, show more carousel images related to the displayed portfolio! It will also feature some other content like titles, descriptions, and link buttons. Using a simple SHORTCODE on different posts or pages, you can showcase your portfolios in a smart way.

= Custom Post & Custom Taxonomy =
Custom Post will ensure all your portfolios to kept in a single post type. In this way, you can distinguish your portfolios from other post types. Taxonomies will categorize your portfolios. This will help you to organize your portfolios. 


= 2 color schemes in style =
There are two color variations for the portfolio gallery plugin, dark and light. You can switch between them and load one up which is suitable for your website.


= Filter effects for portfolio thumbnails =
Filtering image thumbnails with effects is a great way to organize your portfolios. The plugin allows you to filter portfolio thumbnails by categories using CSS-based animations.


= Hover Effects by CSS 3D Transforms =
The power of CSS3 is enormous and a smart choice to present your portfolio items in a very creative way. The plugin lets you create thumbnails of your portfolio using animation & transition effects.


= Thumbnail Grid with Expanding Preview =
By clicking on a thumbnail, the plugin displays the larger image in an expanding preview box. It displays some other content like titles, descriptions, link buttons, and carousel images.


= Custom CSS support =
The portfolio gallery plugin has a custom CSS box. You can add all your custom CSS there to avoid modifying the core plugin files. Since that'll make upgrading the plugin problematic. Your custom CSS will come after the plugin's stylesheets. That means your rules will take precedence.

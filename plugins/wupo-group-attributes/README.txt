== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this plugin different from other group attributes plugins? =

While there exist plugins with a similar feature set we tried to create a version in our own vision with best-in-class features. Among them are a super fast loading of group attributes in the admin area when editing products. Further the rendering of layouts happens with containers and headers and is not solely table-based which gives much more possibilities for a unique page design. And you always have the possibility to create your very own template (PRO version required).

Allows you to collapse and expand the WordPress admin theme menus (Appearance > Menus).

== Description ==

When creating a menu under the "Appearance -> Menus" tab it allows you to double click to expand and collapse a menu tree.

This is particularly useful for large menus or menus with many different sub trees that take up screen space.

Minimized menus will be saved as a cookie so when you return they should be minimized again.

**Requirements**

* Javascript is required.
* A browser that supports the :after CSS selector is required to show the minimized indicators (IE7 and IE8 may not show them).

**Future releases:**  

*   Images to show collapsed menus rather than just a blue marker.
*   Double-click visual feedback.
*   your ideas!

== Installation ==

Drop into either your /mu-plugins/ directory, or your plugins directory and activate it.

1. Upload the `expandable-menus` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or the `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress (if placed in the the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory)
1. Create a menu with some children elements and double click the parent.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Why isn't this working?**

* Have you tried double clicking? A lot of people dont understand you have to double click to minimize as there wasn't initially an indicator telling you to do so.

Easily Sync MailerLite Contacts With Your WordPress Users.

== Description ==

Fast MailerLite is designed to work seamlessly with both the [Fast Flow Dashboard](http://wordpress.org/plugins/fast-flow-dashboard/) and [Fast Member](https://fastmember.com)

Once your contacts have been added to WordPress you now have the ability to sync their Fast Tags and Fast Member purchases.

Fast Tags can be used to trigger automations on any other integrated platform which is supported by our growing number Fast Flow addons.

> NOTE: Fast MailerLite requires the Fast Flow Dashboard to enter the API details and utilise the user tagging.

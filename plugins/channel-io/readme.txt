Channel is a conversational CRM solution that helps online businesses to capture potential customers before they leave the websites.

== Description ==

If you thought there’s only so much you could do to engage in online customer’s journey, think again.
Designed to capture potential customers before they leave your site and increase conversions, the web-based SaaS lets you see who’s on your site, what they’re looking at, how long/frequent they’re visiting and finally, drop in and give a little “hello” to online customers in real time. Actively engage in customer journey through conversations, and manage those conversations and customers by segmenting them into groups of your choice.

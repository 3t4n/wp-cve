== Description ==

This is the job posting manager plugin designed to work with Google Job Posting.

[ Generation of JSON-LD ]

This plugin generates JSON-LD of your recruitment info to register Google Job Posting.
While this plugin will generate JSON-LD, it doesn't guarantee your recruitment info will display on Google Job Posting.
Because the Google Job Posting algorithm is not public.

[ Blocks ]
You can also display your recruitment information by using Gutenberg custom block.
We prepare some styles, you can choose what you prefer to.

[ Custom Fields to enter recruitment info ]
You can enter your recruitment info via each post's custom fields, or you can use common fields in 'Settings' > 'VK Job Posting Settings'.
Once you fill out the common fields, you don't need to fill duplicated info in each post such as company name, logo, and website.
You can overwrite common fields value by fill out each post's custom fields.

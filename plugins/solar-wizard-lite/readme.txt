The first solar power calculator for Wordpress websites. If you're tired of answering the questions" how much does it cost to go solar?

== Description ==

If you’re tired of answering the question “how much does it cost to go solar?” day after day, Trusting Solar Calculator is the ideal plugin for your WordPress site.

The problem today is that everyone will tell the consumer How Much They Can Save but not at what COST. This leaves homeowners nervous about whether they can afford to go solar. As a result, many who may be able to afford solar do not complete the Free Quote Form because they don’t want to be on a list and embarrassed when the price is too high.

Trusting Solar Calculator is easy to use for anyone. Simply select your colors, upload a logo, set your incentives, utility rate, and the price you want to sell at high/low for cash, loan, or solar lease purchases. Trusting Solar Calculator Pro offers solar companies the option to add battery storage for residential, commercial solar settings, EV calculations, currency changes, web hooks, customizable email templates, Google API, supports multi language and more!

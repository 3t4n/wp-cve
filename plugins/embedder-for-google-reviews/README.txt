Embedding Google reviews and customer testimonials help with SEO(Search Engine Optimization).
Many other factors are involved in search rankings, but customer reviews can be a solid signal to Google’s search engine since they communicate trustworthiness and authority.
Here are some reasons why reviews help with your search engine optimization:

- **Google likes to read** - Google “reads” your site to understand the world. The more content there is about your website, the more it will know about your business. Sometimes customers will unintentionally describe your products and services to Google and help him add SEO value to your business.

Still, those depend on the number of wp business reviews, especially the positive ones you get from your customers.

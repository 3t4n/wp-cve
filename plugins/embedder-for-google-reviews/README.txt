== üöÄ Do embedded Google reviews help with SEO? ==
Embedding Google reviews and customer testimonials help with SEO(Search Engine Optimization).
Many other factors are involved in search rankings, but customer reviews can be a solid signal to Google‚Äôs search engine since they communicate trustworthiness and authority.
Here are some reasons why reviews help with your search engine optimization:

- **Google trusts your customers more than it trusts you** - Google depends on signals to determine if the site is competent and worth good rankings or not. When somebody reviews your services, it tells Google your Business is of a certain quality and, most importantly, that other people have interacted with it and can help potential customers make decisions.
- **Google likes to read** - Google ‚Äúreads‚Äù your site to understand the world. The more content there is about your website, the more it will know about your business. Sometimes customers will unintentionally describe your products and services to Google and help him add SEO value to your business.
- **Great reviews => More stars => Increased CTR (Click Through Rate)** - People would usually choose to buy products and services from a business that has more star ratings. Still, those depend on the number of wp business reviews, especially the positive ones you get from your customers. If more people review your business, you will have a better rating and, in turn, increase your wordpress websites traffic and CTA.

<h3>Create Courses with Ease</h3>

Something we hear from users of WP Courses quite frequently is how easy it is to use and to create your own courses. If you can create a WordPress page or post, you can create a course. WP Courses leverages many familiar WordPress interfaces which makes creating courses feel familiar.

<h3>Create Any Type of Lesson for your Courses</h3>

Video lessons are supported with videos hosted on <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.vdocipher.com/">VdoCipher</a> and other platforms. You can also create lessons with text, audio, images and more.

<h3>Organize Your Lessons into Modules</h3>

You'll probably want to organize your lessons into modules for your courses. WP Courses keeps this process incredibly simple. Choose the appropriate course, Click "add new module" and drag it where you want. That's it... Other competing plugins require that you manually attach each lesson to a module. This takes ages!

<h3>Quizzes for your Courses</h3>

Create multiple choice and multiple answer quizzes and select from many options including maximum quiz attempts, if empty answers are allowed, your quiz welcome message and more. Quizzes can also be attached to courses similar as lessons.

<h3>Modern App-Like User Interface</h3>

WP Courses leverages many modern web technologies that allow for extremely quick content loading times as well as lessons and courses that load without having to refresh the page. This leads to a seamless and quick navigation experience for your users that will keep your students more engaged with your course content.

Courses are easy to navigate and look beautiful on any device. All courses will display a mobile friendly navigation and content structure.

<h3>No Coding Required</h3>

<h3>Progress Tracking for all Courses</h3>

Keep your students engaged with progress tracking. Icons and progress bars show your students which lessons they've viewed and completed. You can also view any of your student's progress in the admin area, broken down by lesson and course.

<h3>Courses Analytics Dashboard</h3>

See which courses are the most popular, which students are most engaged and how many people are viewing and completing lessons of which course each day.

<h3>Restrict Course Lesson Content</h3>

Restrict your course lesson content to logged in users only with the click of a button. Individual course lessons can be restricted for fine control over your content's visibility.

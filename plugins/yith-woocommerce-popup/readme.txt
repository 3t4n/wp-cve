== Description ==

Popups are a powerful tool to catch your users' attention: direct and customizable, with YITH WooCommerce Popup you will be able to use them in the best way to accomplish your achievements.
Add them in every page you want, using a template you can customize freely: create the best popup window for your needs, and add a message, a newsletter form or the products of your own shop.


**Plugin's features:**

* Popup settings section
* Creation of endless popups
* Freedom to assign one different popup for each page
* Add a form for newsletter
* Modify graphically the popup style
* Add products from the store

== Installation ==
Important: First of all, you have to download and activate WooCommerce plugin, which is mandatory for YITH WooCommerce Popup to be working.

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Popup` from Plugins page.


= Configuration =
YITH WooCommerce Popup will add a new tab called "Popup" in "YITH" menu item. There, you will find all YITH plugins with quick access to plugin setting page.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the main changes in plugin translation? =
Recently YITH WooCommerce Popup has been selected to be included in the "translate.wordpress.org" translate programme.
In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'ypop' to 'yith-woocommerce-popup'.
Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org.
During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in:

* yith-woocommerce-popup-[WORDPRESS LOCALE].po
* yith-woocommerce-popup-[WORDPRESS LOCALE].mo

Tags: categories, sidebar, widget, navigation
Requires at least: 5.0
Tested up to: 6.4.1
Stable tag: 3.0.8

Adds a widget which uses Javascript to dynamically expand or collapse the set of
posts for each category.

== Description ==
Collapsing Categories creates an expandable list of categories and
subcategories. It can also expand to show posts. The primary usage is as a
widget, but you can also use the code in your theme manually if you wish (see
installation instructions)

== Installation ==

IMPORTANT!
Please deactivate before upgrading, then re-activate the plugin. 

Unpackage contents to wp-content/plugins/ so that the files are in a
collapsing-categories directory.

= Widget installation = 

 Activate the plugin, then simply go the
Presentation > Widgets section and drag over the Collapsing Categories Widget.


= Manual installation = 

 Activate the plugin, then insert the following into your template: (probably
in sidebar.php). See the Options section for more information on specifying
options.
`
<?php 
echo "<ul class='collapsCatList'>\n";
if (function_exists('collapsCat')) {
  collapsCat();
} else {
  wp_get_categories('your_options_here');
}
echo "</ul>\n";
?>
`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= How do I use different symbols for collapsing and expanding? =

If you want to use images, you can upload your own images to
http://yourblogaddress/wp-content/plugins/collapsing-categories/img/collapse.gif
and expand.gif

There is an option for this.

= I have selected a category to expand by default, but it doesn't seem to work =

If you select a sub-category to expand by default, but not the parent
category, you will not see the sub-category expanded until you expand the
parent category.  You probably want to add both the parent and the
sub-category into the expand by default list.

= I can't get including or excluding to work = 

Make sure you specify category names, not ids.

= There seems to be a newline between the collapsing/expanding symbol and the
category name. How do I fix this? =

If your theme has some css that says something like

#sidebar li a {display:block}

that is the problem. 
You probably want to add a float:left to the .sym class

= No categories are showing up! What's wrong?" =

Are you using categories or tags? By default, collapsing categories only lists
categories. Please check the options in the settings page (or in the widget if
you are using the widget)

=  How do I change the style of the collapsing categories lists? =

As of version 2.0, there are several default styles that come with
collapsing-categories. You can choose from these in the widget settings , or you
can create your own custom style. A good strategy is to choose a default, then
modify it slightly to your needs. 

The following classes are used:
* collapsing-categories - applied to all ul and li elements
* list - applied to the top-level ul
* item - applied to each li which has no sub-elements
* expand - applied to a category which can be expanded (is currently
  collapsed)
* collapse - applied to a category which can be collapsed (is currently
  expanded)
* sym - class for the expanding / collapsing symbol

An example:
`
<ul id='widget-collapscat-15-top ' class='collapsing-categories list'>
  <li class='collapsing-categories post'><a
    href='http://mysite.com/your-website/about-your-own-site/'
    title='About your own site'>About your own site</a>
  </li>
  <li class='collapsing-categories'><span class='collapsing-categories expand'
    onclick='expandCollapse(event, "▶","▼", 1, "collapsing categories"); return
    false'><span class='sym'>▶</span>Web hosting</span>
    <ul id='collapsCat-176-15' style="display:none">
      <li class='collapsing-categories post'><a 
        href='http://mysite.com/your-website/web-hosting/about-webhosting/'
        title='About webhosting'>About webhosting</a>
      </li>
      <li class='collapsing-categories post'><a 
        href='http://mysite.com/products/webhosting-1/'
        title='Webhosting #1'>Webhosting #1</a>
      </li>
      <li class='collapsing-categories post'><a 
        href='http://mysite.com/products/webhosting-2/'
        title='Webhosting #2'>Webhosting #2</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li> <!-- ending subcategory -->
`

== Screenshots ==

1. a few expanded categories with default theme, showing nested categories
2. Standard Widget options 
3. Advanced options

== Options ==
Options can be set
from the block panel. If you wish to insert the code into your theme manually
instead of using a widget, you can use the following options. These options
can be given to the `collapsCat()` function either as an array or in query
style, in the same manner as the `wp_list_categories` function.

`$defaults=array(
   'showPostCount' => true,
   'inExclude' => 'exclude',
   'inExcludeCats' => '',

= Examples =

`collapsCat('catSort=ASC&expand=3&inExcludeCats=general,uncategorized')`
This will produce a list with:
* categories shown in alphabetical order
* using images to mark collapsing and expanding
* exclude posts from  the categories general and uncategorized

```
<?php
					echo '<ul class="collapsCatList" id="widget-collapscat-0-top">' . "\n";
					if (function_exists('collapsCat')) {
					  collapsCat(array(
							'postSort' => 'postDate',
							'postSortOrder' => 'DESC',
						) );
					} else {
					  wp_get_categories('your_options_here');
					}
					echo "</ul>\n";
					?>
```

== Demo ==

I use this plugin in my blog at http://robfelty.com


== CAVEAT ==

Currently this plugin relies on Javascript to expand and collapse the links.
If a user's browser doesn't support javascript they won't see the links to the
posts, but the links to the categories will still work (which is the default
behavior in wordpress anyways)

* fixed bug with extraneous <ul>

=  0.4.1 =
		* fixed bug with get_sub_cat definition problem in WP 2.5. Looks like it

* Fixed bug introduced in version 0.3.5 where all links in a category

=  0.3.5 =
* Now links should work with all sorts of permalink structures. Thanks to
  Krysthora http://krysthora.free.fr/ for finding this bug

=  0.3.4 =
* Added option to sort categories by id or name

=  0.3.3 =
* fixed bug in headers when collapsCat is not loaded
* fixed a few minor markup issues to make it valid xhtml

=  0.3.2 =
* posts now have the class "collapsCatPost" and can be styled with CSS.
  Some styling has been added in collapsCat.php
* removed list icons in front of triangles

=  0.3.1 =
* Added option to make post links to index.php, root, or archive.php, like
  collapsing-categories
* Fixed link to category listings

=  0.3 =
* Now uses only 2 database queries instead of 1 + 2*(count(categories))
* Now supports infinite levels of subcategories

=  0.2.2:  =
* Added option to show pages in list or not

=  0.2.1:  =
* Added collapsing class to <li>s with triangles for CSS styling
* Added style information to make triangles bigger and give a pointer
  cursor over them
* Added title tags to triangles to indicate functionality
		* Checking whether some of the same functionality from collapsing-categories
		  has already been loaded (for example the javascript file) in order to
		  avoid redundancy

=  0.2:  =
* Changed name from Fancy categories to Collapsing categories
* Changed author from Andrew Rader to Robert Felty
* Added triangles which mark the collapsing and expanding features
  That is, clicking on the triangle collapses or expands, while clicking
  on a category links to the category list for the said category.
  This uses html entities (dings) instead of images, for a variety of 
  reasons
* Lists the titles of posts, instead of just listing subcategories
* Removed the rel='hide' and rel='show' tags, because they are not xhtml
  1.0 compliant. Now uses the CSS classes instead
		* MOST IMPORTANTLY -- is compatible with both the pre 2.3 database which
		  uses categories, and the 2.3+ database structure which uses the tag
		  taxonomy

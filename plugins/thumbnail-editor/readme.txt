Manually Crop and Resize thumbnail images that are uploaded in the Media section. 

== Description ==

When images are uploaded in the WordPress Media library section WordPress creates some thumbnails of that image. The size of these thumbnail images can be mentioned in the `Settings->Media` section. 

But there can be some big issues with these thumbnails. WordPress Crop/Resize these images dynamically when you upload an image. When thumbnails are CROPPED it is very much possible that it gets CROPPED from the wrong section of the uploaded image. This can produce some BAD looking thumbnail images. Which doesn't look good in frontend of the site. This plugin will allow you to update those thumbnail images manually. The thumbnail image edit interface that this plugin provides is simple and very easy to use.

The shortcodes and functions are provided in the image editor page of the plugin.

Image editor links can be found in WordPress Media Library.

Image files that can be edited are <strong>JPG, JPEG, GIF and PNG</strong>

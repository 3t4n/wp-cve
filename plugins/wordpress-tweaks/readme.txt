WordPress Tweaks is a powerful yet simple plugin to help you push the boundaries of WordPress by fine-tuning its many aspects. This multi-purpose plugin specializes in simple toggle-on/off changes and dropdown selections. It adds many useful settings pertaining to comments, posts, media, the administration back-end, and much more. Some tweaks can even replace plugins that you may already have installed.

The WordPress Tweaks plugin adds a "Tweaks" page to your "Settings" menu. Each individual tweak can be enabled/disabled at will using a checkbox or dropdown. An instant search bar makes it a snap to find the tweak you're looking for.

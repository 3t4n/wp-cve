== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why I can't see the right shipping options on checkout? =

WooCommerce Shipping Zones settings: drag the shipping zones with cities to the top of the list.
The plugin doesn't support the WooCommerce Cart/Checkout Blocks.

= Why I can't see the city field on checkout/emails? =

Make sure to not disable the fields: billing_country, billing_state, shipping_country, shipping_state.
Make sure to config the shop country in WooCommerce general settings.

= How to create default shipping zone for a country? =

Create shipping zone and select the country itself and drag this shipping zone to be under the shipping zone with the specific cities in the shipping zones list.

= Why the cities dropdown is slow? =

The cities list must be minimized. if it's slow only in the frontend this could be done with the 'Selling Locations' option, otherwise with the 'csz_cities'/'csz_states' filters and consider using the 'Custom City' feature (instructions in docs).

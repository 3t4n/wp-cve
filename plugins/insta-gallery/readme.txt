* And much more!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display pictures from Instagram Tag? =

Yes, you can.

= Can I display pictures in Instagram Widget? =

Yes, you can.

= Why are my pictures not showing on the page? =

You have to update your Instagram access token to display user media.

=How to add Instagram Gallery to a widget? =

Go to your admin dashboard, add a new Instagram gallery, then go to widgets, add Instagram Gallery Widget, and select the Gallery item from the dropdown list.

= Why are there two popups on image click? =

There may be other plugins (like fancybox, elementor) that also use image links to open popups. Try disabling the popup images option in the setting panel of this plugin, which will allow other plugins to work.

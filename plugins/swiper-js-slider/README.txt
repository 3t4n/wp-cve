== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add the slider to my site? =

You can add your slider by shortcode.

= How to include a slider in a post or a page? =

[swiper-js-slider id=Here comes the slider id]

= How to include a slider into header.php or other PHP files? =

echo do_shortcode('[swiper-js-slider id=Here comes the slider id]');

= What should I do when I see blank area where the slider should show or the slider doesn’t work? =

It means that there is a JavaScript error on your site which blocks other scripts (for example Swiper Js Slider scripts). You can open up the browser debugger window with F12 button and check the console if it shows error or not. If you solve these errors Swiper Js Slider should work fine.

Usual problem is that you have the latest WordPress version, but your theme loads very old jQuery version (1.7 or older) and the WordPress admin bar throws a JavaScript error. In this case, you have to remove the old jQuery from your theme’s functions.php.

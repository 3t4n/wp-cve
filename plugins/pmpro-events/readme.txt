Create private events, hide event details, & restrict event registration for members-only using popular events calendar plugins with PMPro.

== Description ==

### The best way to create private events and restrict event registration for members-only with WordPress.

Create a fully-featured membership community or association website with private events and registration for members-only. This plugin integrates Paid Memberships Pro with the most popular free events plugins for WordPress including:

* [Events Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/)
* [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/)
* [Sugar Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sugar-calendar-lite/)
* [Timely All-in-One Events Calendar (before version 3)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/)

= Hide Event Details From Non-Members =

Create or edit an event with your calendar plugin of choice. The event editor includes the "Require Membership" meta box bundled with Paid Memberships Pro.

This plugin filters the event information shown in your event lists, event categories, calendar views, and single event landing pages. You can control how much information is shown to public visitors in the plugin settings.

* Protect any event by checking the boxes for your desired membership levels.
* Private events do not allow non-members to view full event details or complete event registration.
* Supports recurring events for all modules. Membership requirements automatically copy over from the 'parent' event.

= Hide Private Events From The Public =

You can completely hide member-restricted events to non-members. This means that only logged in members can see any event details.

Hidden events are a secret—these events are not shown in your event lists, event categories, and calendar views.

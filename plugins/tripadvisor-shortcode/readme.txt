== Description ==

I have been told by TripAdvisor that they are about to turn off the business owner rss feeds. This plugin no longer works.


== Screenshots ==

1. TripAdvisor feeds displayed by the shortcode.


== Changelog ==

= 2.2 =

* End of plugin - Tripadvisor has informed me they are to turn off the rss feeds.

= 2.0 =

* added a buffering option. If you have a complez theme and the shortcode keeps appearing at the top of the page rather than where you place it then this could help. Only switch this on in the settings of it is needed. 


= 2.0 =

* You can now use shortcode attributes to add more than one OwnerFeed to your web site, which is ideal for multi-nit operators. Please be aware that TripAdvisor terms and conditions for ownerfeeds means no moe than 50 feeds per web site. Contact them if you need more.

Use the shortcode attribute name, url and id to add a feed. Any attribute not filled in will be taken from the main settings page. An example shortcode for the Half Moon Inn in Abergavenny would be:

[tripadvisorsc name="Half Moon Inn" url="Hotel_Review-g186433-d297243-Reviews-Half_Moon_Inn-Abergavenny_Monmouthshire_Southern_Wales_Wales.html" id="297243"]

The name is what you want to be places at Reviews for: , the url is the tripadvosr page url excluding the relevent triadvisor domain such as tripadvisor.com/ , the id is the property id number less the d (you can find it in the url as dxxxx).


= 1.0 =

* Say hello to the TripAdvisor plugin if your travel based web site is running on Wordpress and features in Tripadvisor.

== Upgrade Notice ==


= 2.2 =

* End of plugin - Tripadvisor has informed me they are to turn off the rss feeds.

= 2.0 =
You can now add more than 1 Ownerfeed to your web site but be aware of tripadvisors terms and conditions that restricts you to no more than 50 feeds per web site.

= 1.0 =

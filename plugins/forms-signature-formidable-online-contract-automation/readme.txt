*Please note you will need the following plugins installed to completely automate the process of collection of contracts using Formidable Forms and WP E-Signature.*

1. [Formidable Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/formidable-forms-lite/)

2. [WP E-Signature](https://aprv.me/2llm6iC) (Elite or Plus license)

3. [Stand Alone Document](https://aprv.me/2llm6iC) (comes with above licenses)
4. Signature Add-On by ApproveMe (this plugin)

*An Elite or Plus license is required and can be purchased at [www.approveme.com](https://www.approveme.com/formidable-forms-special-pricing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=formidable-forms)


**If you ever had to defend your contracts in front of a judge, are you sure they would hold up?**


Most business owners would be quick to say yes, but the truth is, just having your client’s signature is not enough.  Not anymore.

When your contract isn’t valid, there isn’t much you can do to protect yourself.

E-Signing has grown into a massive industry, giving way to a long list of rules and regulations that all documents must adhere to.

If the validity of your contracts, invoices, or partner agreements were to come into question, the dangers are clear:  your entire business could be at risk.

We’re here to make sure that never happens.

**The ApproveMe WP E-Signature Plugin for Formidable Forms turns your Wordpress website into a court recognized legal document signing application.**

Now, there is no doubt that Formidable Forms is an incredible plugin.  It’s great at automating tasks and streamlining forms on your website... BUT, ensuring that all forms are legally binding is NOT their specialty.  Our plugin fills that void.

This e-signature Add-On for Formidable Forms ensures that every contract, form or invoice submitted with the plugin is 100% UETA/ESIGN compliant.

Never again will you have to question the legality of your forms or pay for a third-party signing service to feel secure.

The ApproveMe team has invested a lot time and resources into building a system that plays nicely with the rules and regulations of any country where e-signing is used.

This plugin gives you the power to control your user experience while staying fully protected.


**[Click Here to Try Formidable Forms Signature Demo](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=formidable-forms)**

**Other Signature Plugins & Add-Ons** simply record the details of signatures and submit the data to a web server.  The image file gets saved to your FTP server.  Sound safe?  It’s not.


That image file of your client’s hand written legal signature is made easily accessible to FTP intruders.  Since most other plugins are not legally binding (and certainly not UETA/ESIGN compliant) you would have a serious problem if your files got in the hands of the wrong people.

Fraud and identity theft become much bigger and more serious problems when your contracts are non-binding.  Why risk it?


**The Powerful Features of ApproveMe’s e-signature Add-On for Formidable Forms:**

*UETA/ESIGN Compliance*

We closely track all e-signature rules and regulations so that our plugin is always 100% compliant and up to date.  Rest easy knowing that any contract, form, or invoice signed with our plugin will stand up in front of a judge.

*Encrypted Data Storage*

We will never store any of your data on an FTP server.  We encrypt and store your data in different strategic locations within your database.  Every single thing from your document data to your custom input fields will be secure.

In fact, if an FTP intruder even tried to unencrpyt any of your data, the entire document would destroy itself.  We don’t mess around when it comes to security.


*Instantly Trigger Contracts*

One of the best ways to get your contracts signed?  Keep your clients from getting distracted.  Our plugin allows you to immediately redirect signers to your contract after they submit a form.


*Unique Signer Invitations*

Don’t let just anyone download your PDF documents.  We added an extra layer of security.  Only when the sender (you) is logged in and the signer uses their unique invitation can a signed PDF be downloaded.  Greatly reduces the risk of anyone unauthorized seeing your contract.


*Responsive Design*

Now you and your clients can sign on the go with mobile signing.  Our plugin works seamlessly with all desktop and mobile browsers for Android and iOS including Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.

*Dynamic Form Fields*

Dynamic form fields allow you to customize contracts based on your signer’s info.  You can sync even the most complex form fields with your contracts.


*Signing Reminder Emails*

Need to give your client a gentle nudge?  Automatic reminder emails will make sure your contract gets signed.  You choose the trigger date and the frequency.

*Zero Monthly Fees Per User + Unlimited Users*

You and your team are free to create as many contracts as you like.  Everyone on your team can access the plugin with no limits or hidden fees.  That’s our promise.

This plugin is amazing for Freelancers, Web Designers, Photographers and Small Business owners who want to simplify their contract generation process.

###Get started by following these steps to set up your Formidable Forms Signature Plugin###


**Step 1:**
ApproveMe's WP E-Signature requires a few more plugins/add-ons to help you release the full power and automate Formidable Forms as well as Digital Signatures that are legally binding. The following plugins are required:

1. [Formidable Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/formidable/)
2. [WP E Signature](https://www.approveme.com/formidable-forms-special-pricing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=formidable-forms) (Elite or Plus license)
3. [E-Signature Add-ons Pack](https://www.approveme.com/wpesign-features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=formidable-forms) (comes with your license above)
4.  Signature Add-On by ApproveMe(this plugin)

**Step 2:**
*Input your ApproveMe license*
After buying a license from ApproveMe, you must input your new license key to launch upgrades and access technical support.
Log into your account to download your license key [ApproveMe account](https://www.approveme.com/sign-in/) here (your password is included in the receipt emailed to you)

**Step 3:**
*Set up a blank WordPress page*
Once the WP e-signature plugins and add-ons have been installed and your configurations are saved, you must set up a blank WordPress webpage for every Stand Alone Document (or contract) you will be producing/sending to your form submitters.
Discover more about Stand Alone Documents by visiting this [helpful article](https://wpe.approveme.com/article/156-basic-document-vs-stand-alone-document?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=formidable-forms)


**Step 4:**

*Set up a Stand Alone Document*
Using your new blank WordPress page, you will then need to produce a Stand Alone Document and then connect the WordPress page to our Stand Alone Document.
Find out more about Stand Alone Documents by visiting [documentation page](https://wpe.approveme.com/article/137-stand-alone-documents-add-on?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=formidable-forms) for this add-on.


**Step 5:**
*(optional) Input Formidable User Details into a Contract*

This step will change depending on what you want for the desired outcome.  Approve Me's Digital Signature is triggered once a Formidable Form is submitted. You’ve got the power to incorporate Formidable Form user info (which was inputted from the customer once the form was submitted) into a brand new custom contract form which will either be emailed to the customer or shown to the customer after they submit the form.


**How to use Formidable Forms to add form fields details into a contract**

Go to the Signer Input Fields/Custom Fields symbol and choose "Formidable Form Data".

Choose the Formidable Form that you’ve already made (and want to link with your contract form) using the drop down option list.
 
Pick the field info you want to include in your new contract.

A shortcode is created using this data. Don’t worry — your customer will only see the real field value when signing your contract.
This is an example of the auto-generated shortcode which will get placed in the document you are producing when you select your desired field value from your Formdiable Form.


[esig formdiable formid="3" field_id="1" ]


You can easily transfer the shortcode to any place in your contract form.  It will show the customer’s provided info anywhere the shortcode is found.



**Step 6:**

*Select your document preferences and save settings*


Once you’ve inserted all the required contract text and linked your WP form fields to your Stand Alone Document, it’s time to choose your document settings.


Important note: Before you can post your contract form, you must link your Stand Alone Document to the blank WordPress webpage you made previously for your contract. Do this by looking for and choosing the webpage from the "Display on this page" drop down option list found under the "Document Options" area. 

We decided NOT to include this page in your nav menu since it will be connected to a Formidable Form and will not work properly unless it has the field values of that submitted Formidable Form.


**Step 7:**

*Almost there… (halfway done)*

Once you've published your Stand Alone Document, you’re halfway done. In the next step you have to pick your "trigger" and "action" selections for this document in Formidable Forms.


Select LET'S GO NOW! to establish those final Formidable Forms preferences.




**Step 8:**

*Finalize creating the Formidable Form workflow/trigger*

Almost there!  Now all you need to do is select your contract and your preferred actions once the workflow is activated.

Go to the "Forms" tab located in the WordPress control panel.

Select the form you attached to the Stand Alone Document.

Choose the "E-Signature" choice within the form options and specify the remaining options.

Now You're done!

== Screenshots ==

1. **Add New Document:** After installing the WP E-Signature, you will need to draft up a new “Stand Alone Document”



2. **Formidable Forms Data** If you click the Signer Input Fields icon you will see the option “Formidable Forms Data.” Click this to connect a WP Form to this contract.



3. **Select Your Formidable Forms:**  If you already have your Formidable Form created you can easily insert dynamic field data (from the form that is being submitted/triggering this contract) by selecting the Formidable Form.


4. **Choose Your Formidable Forms Fields:** After selecting your Formidable Form you will see the available field options from this particular Formidable Form. You can easily insert dynamic data from your form anywhere in this new contract.



5. **Connect Your Document to a Page:**Once you’re satisfied with your contract, you will need to select a BLANK WordPress page to attach this document to. 

Important: Do NOT include this page in your Nav menu.  All of the magic actually happens after the Formidable Form is submitted (there’s no need to link to this page because the user will either be emailed a custom link or they will be automatically redirected once the Formidable Form is submitted).



6. **Click “LET’S GO NOW”:**After you have published your contract, you just need to connect your Stand Alone Document to your Formidable Form. This is pretty straight forward. Just click the “LET’S GO NOW!” button to be redirected to the actions/trigger tab for your specific form.

7. **Define Your Signing Logic:** This is the page (inside of Formidable Forms) that needs to be customized. Please choose the Signer’s Full Name and the Signer’s Email address along with any other additional e-signature settings you’d like to include with your contract.


8. **How to Get to the E-Signature Tab** Once you are inside of your Formidable Form click “Settings”

9. **Form Actions** Now we’ll need to select the “Form Actions” option to get to the “E-Signature” related options.

10. **E-Signature Icon** Click the “Pen Icon” to step into the E-Signature related settings.


11. **User Submits a Formidable Forms** Once a user submits the Formidable Form that you connected to your e-signature contract, they will either be immediately redirected to the contract or emailed a unique invitation to sign their contract.  All submitted details from Formidable Forms will be included.


12. **Review & eSign:** With their e-signature, the customers agree to the terms of the document.


13. **Select a Digital Signature:**Signers can choose a typed or digital signature



14. **Agree & eSign:** With their e-signature, the customers agree to the terms of the document.


15. **View Signed Document Email:**Signers will be sent an email that includes the link to the document (and a PDF version of the contract if you opted for this method).



16. **Save as PDF:**Customers can either view, print or download their signed document from the website. To do this, they need to click “View Signed Document” in the email that was sent to them upon signing. (With the “Attach as PDF” add-on installed, you can also automatically include the signed contract as a PDF attachment in this email.)



17. **WordPress Audit Trail e-signature Certificate:**  Proving signer intent is a very important component to signing electronic documents. Every contract that is signed using WP E-Signature includes a detailed Signature Certificate. You can [read all about the security of this report here](https://www.approveme.com/wordpress-audit-trail-e-signature-certificate/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=formidable-forms).

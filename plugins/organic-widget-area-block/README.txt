The Widget Area Block allows for multiple custom Widget Areas to be created on any page or post using the Gutenberg block editor.

== Description ==

The Widget Area Block allows for multiple custom Widget Areas to be created on any page or post using the Gutenberg block editor. As a result, traditional widgets can be used along side blocks within your content. The plugin can be used to create new sidebars within layout blocks, or add widgets directly within your content.

There are many useful widgets that cannot be used with the WordPress 5 block editor. This custom block is designed to remedy that problem.

Simply add the Widget Area Block anywhere within your content. Then, name your custom Widget Area. Then, click the Customizer View button to add widgets to that section within the WordPress Customizer.

This block work perfectly with the [Organic Builder Widgets Pro](https://organicthemes.com/builder/ "Organic Builder Widgets Pro") builder plugin. So, widgets and blocks can be used side-by-side to create dynamic page content.

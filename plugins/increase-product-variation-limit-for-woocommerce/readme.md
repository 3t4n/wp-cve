# Increase Product Variation Limit For WooCommerce

This plugin adds a setting to increase variation threshold limit.

## Description

When your variable product has more than 30 variations, WooCommerce starts to use AJAX to load your selected variation.
This might break some pages or produce unexpected behavior. This plugin simply adds a setting to increase this limit. It's that simple.

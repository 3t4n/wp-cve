This plugin is **THE most complete solution for recording, sorting and maintaining GDPR & LGPD records of consent for optimal privacy compliance**.

== iubenda and Third-party services ==

The iubenda plugin makes use of two iubenda services:

1. A service named **Quick generator** that allows you to login/signup on iubenda.com and creates privacy policies for your website right from the plugin. The service is publicly available and described in detail on the [official documentation page](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/37013-api-docs-quick-generator-manual) on the iubenda website.
2. An internal service to scan the user's website and detect the correct data privacy settings to be applied, depending on the website location.
External CSS and JS assets used in the plugin or applied to the user's website by iubenda are delivered either by [cdn.iubenda.com](http://cdn.iubenda.com/) or [cdn.ampproject.org](https://cdn.ampproject.org/) (only when the AMP settings are [activated](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/22135-cookie-solution-amp-wordpress#wordpress)). Any services available at [cdn.iubenda.com](http://cdn.iubenda.com/) are provided by iubenda and the respective privacy policy applies. Any services available at [cdn.ampproject.org](http://cdn.ampproject.org/) are provided by Google and the respective privacy policy applies.
If you integrate the Privacy Controls and Cookie Solution to allow your website to request and manage consent for the use of cookies and similar technologies, when the final user navigates on your website/application, then the [Privacy Policy of iubenda Privacy Controls and Cookie Solution](https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/36700132) applies.
Similarly, when you integrate the Consent Database tool to keep track of the user’s consent activities and store the information necessary to record evidence of that consent, then the [Privacy Policy of iubenda Consent Database](https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/94654098) applies.
For further details on the iubenda tools and services privacy policies please refer to the [privacy policy](https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/252372) on the iubenda website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Updating to version 3 =

If you are experiencing troubles updating to the latest version, please ensure that your cookie banner is correctly activated and configured, and you've cleaned up you WordPress cache. In case of emergency, you can safely rollback to the previous version by [using WP Rollback](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/1215-cookie-solution-wordpress-plugin-installation-guide#further-information-1).


= Do you have a Knowledge base or documentation? =

Our extensive documentation makes it easy for you to learn all you need to know about compliance and how to use iubenda’s products on your site or app. **[You can access it here](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help)**. You can also visit our support forum [here](https://support.iubenda.com/support/home).


= How do I know which laws apply to me and what I need to comply with? =

A good rule of thumb is to always comply with the laws of the region where you are based as well as the region or country in which the users you target are based.

📌 However, for an even easier, more specific way to tell which laws apply to you, you can [simply take this 1-minute quiz](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help#quiz).


= Do I really need a cookie banner or cookie notice? =

If you’re based in the European Union – including the UK – or target EU users, and your website uses [cookies or trackers](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/22419-how-to-identify-the-cookies-used-by-your-website) (which it most likely does), then, yes, you do need a cookie notice.

= Why do I need a privacy policy? =

A privacy policy is a legal requirement almost everywhere in the world. You need it because under most countries’ laws, you’re legally required to inform your users about the data you’re collecting and how you’re processing them.

Find out what should be in a privacy policy [here](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/6187-what-should-be-in-a-privacy-policy).

= Are terms and conditions necessary? =

While Terms and conditions aren’t always legally mandatory, they’re [always recommended](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/2859-terms-and-conditions-when-are-they-needed). They help you protect you and your business from legal liabilities.

However, please note that if you run an **e-commerce, then you’ll most likely need terms and conditions**, as they usually contain legally mandatory information related to commerce.


= What is the GDPR and UK-GDPR (DSGVO & RGPD) =

GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679). The GDPR specifies how personal data should be lawfully processed (including how it’s collected, used, protected or interacted with in general).

While it was still an EU member state, the UK was very instrumental in the creation of the GDPR and therefore, Post-Brexit, has adopted the UK-GDPR – which currently is essentially the same as the European GDPR.

DSGVO & RGPD are, respectively, the German and Spanish translations of the English acronym of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

[Learn more about the GDPR here.](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5428-gdpr-guide)

= What is the ePrivacy or Cookie Law? =

In effect since 2002, the ePrivacy Directive (Cookie Law) was created to put guidelines in place for electronic privacy, including email marketing and cookie usage.

Under the Cookie law, organizations that target users from the EU must **inform users about data collection activities** and give them the option to **choose whether it’s allowed or not**.


This means that if **your site/app** (or **any third-party service** used by your site/app) uses cookies or similar technologies, you must first obtain valid consent **prior** to the installation of those cookies, except where they fall into [the exempt category](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5525#exemptions).
In practice, you’ll need to:

* show a **cookie banner** at the user’s first visit;
* implement a **cookie policy** that contains all required information;
* allow the user to provide or refuse **consent;**
* block cookie/ tracker scripts from running until consent is provided.

You can learn more about [how the ePrivacy and GDPR interact in regards to cookies and trackers here](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5525-cookies-gdpr-requirements).

= What is PECR =

The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR) is the UK's implementation of the EU's ePrivacy directive and set's out rules for electronic privacy

= What are the CCPA and CalOPPA =

California’s most well known Privacy Laws are some of the most robust in the United States. They are both relevant to you if you likely have users that are based in the state of California.

**California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) - since 2002**
Law requires commercial websites and services to have a privacy policy.
The document:

* Must clearly state what info is collected and who it's shared with.
* Must disclose how a business’s website or online service responds to Do Not Track signals from Web browsers.
* Must include the effective date of the Privacy Policy and more.

**California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)**

* Grants users additional rights such as the right to be informed and the right to access information you’ve collected about them - but perhaps, most relevant to marketing is the right to Opt-out.
* Under the CCPA, users have the right to opt-out of any processing that can be considered a *sale* of their data. Sale, in this context, is quite broad and simply means *sharing for any profit- monetary or otherwise*.

***Note that in the case of minors, they are granted the right to Opt-in.** *[More about the CCPA here.](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/19133-ccpa-compliance-guide)

= What is the LGPD? =

The Brazilian General Data Protection Law, the ***Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais***, (LGPD) can be considered as Brazil’s answer to the GDPR – with the Brazilian law aligning with the EU Regulation in many ways, while differing in others. [You can learn more about it here](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/26706-lgpd-guide).

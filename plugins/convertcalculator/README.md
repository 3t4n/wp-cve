## Requirements

The plugin requires a ConvertCalculator account. Sign up for free at [http://www.convertcalculator.co](http://www.convertcalculator.co?utm_source=wordpress.org).

## Installation

Installing "ConvertCalculator" can be done either by searching for "ConvertCalculator" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org.
2. Upload the ZIP file through the "Plugins > Add New > Upload" screen in your WordPress dashboard.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Make sure you have a calculator ready to be embedded. You can build one via [http://app.convertcalculator.co](http://app.convertcalculator.co?utm_source=wordpress.org)
5. Navigate to your calculator (on [http://app.convertcalculator.co](http://app.convertcalculator.co?utm_source=wordpress.org)) and click on "Embed on your website". Copy the calculator id
6. Place the calculator on your site using one of the following methods:

- Place `<?php convertcalculator_add_calculator($calculator_id); ?>` in your template(s). This function call takes up to one required parameter: the `id` parameter, which is the `id` you just copied.
  - Insert a shortcode into page or post content like this `[convertcalculator id="CALC_ID"]`.
  - If you need to use our legacy ["in-page" embed method](https://www.convertcalculator.com/help/embedding/#framed-embed-vs-in-page-embed), add the "type" property to the shortcode, like this: `[convertcalculator id="CALC_ID" type="in-page"]`

To hide unused functions from the administration. Make it clear.

== Description ==

There are always parts in the WP administration you don't currently need. This plugin makes it easy to hide them - like unnecessary menu items or any of the boxes on the posting screen (like custom fields or trackback box). Unclutter the administration and work faster.

You can also input your own CSS code to modify the look of administration.

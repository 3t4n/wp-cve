== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add the Caddy cart icon & link to my menu or header? =

Caddy has an option in it's settings to insert the cart icon into your menu. If you want to add the cart icon somewhere else in your header you can use our widget or shortcode:

Widget:
Search for the "Caddy Cart" widget and add it to your header. 

Shortcodes:
Or, you can use our included shortcodes using the "Shortcodes in Menus" plugin and then adding the following Caddy shortcodes:
\[cc_saved_items text='Saves' icon='yes'\]
\[cc_cart_items text='Cart' icon='yes'\]

The "text" value is the text that you want to appear in your menu.
The "icon" value (yes or no) will display a heart icon for the "Saves" link and a cart icon for the "Cart" link

= Does Caddy work with multisite? =

Yes.

= Can I translate Caddy? =

Absolutely! You can find instructions [here](https://usecaddy.com/docs/developers/how-to-translate-caddy-into-different-languages).

= Will Caddy slow down my site? =

No. We‚Äôve built Caddy with performance in mind and have fine tuned it for speed.

## Development

Code for the endpoints is generated automatically using a custom version of [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator).

To regenerate endpoints, use the docker laucher packaged in `vendor/bin`:

```bash
./vendor/bin/elastic-openapi-codegen.sh
```

The custom generator will be built and launched using the following Open API spec file : `resources/api/api-spec.yml`.

You can then commit and PR the modified api-spec file and your endpoints code files.

The client class and readme may be changed in some cases. Do not forget to include them in your commit!

Activate this plugin to disable the auto-generated WP Sitemaps (added in WP v5.5).



== Description ==

> Does one thing: disables the automatic WP Sitemaps.

Activate this plugin to disable the auto-generated WP Sitemaps (added in WordPress v5.5).


**Features**

* Lightweight - only one line of code.
* Simple to use - activate and done.
* No settings to worry about.
* Easy peasy.

Also stops WordPress from adding a sitemap rule to the virtual robots.txt file.


**Why is this useful?**

Because there are plugins that already implement sitemaps, and those plugins are used by a LOT of people. So all those sites with existing sitemaps will have TWO sets of sitemaps when upgraded to WP 5.5. Duplicate sets of sitemaps are discouraged as they may confuse the search engines. You don't want to confuse the search engines, do you. So with WP 5.5 and beyond, you can either remove your existing sitemap solution or install this plugin to disable the WP-generated sitemap. Or maybe you have a site that does not need a sitemap. Or maybe you just don't want a sitemap, that's your business pal. Whatever the reason, this plugin will do the job with a click.


**More infos**

You can check your WP Sitemap located at `/wp-sitemap.xml`

Your sitemap should look similar to [this](https://dev-tricks.com/wp-sitemap.xml).

= WordPress Single Sign-On / SSO ( Login to WordPress ) =

WordPress Single Sign-On (WordPress SSO) allows users to log into any website/application using the single set of credentials of another app/site.
**Example:** Let's say you have all your users/customers/members/employees stored on a site, called 'site A' and you want all of them to register/login using WordPress SSO to your WordPress site called 'site B'. In this scenario, you can register/login all your users of site A into site B using the login credentials/account of site A. This is called Single Sign-On or SSO.

*Please note you will need the following plugins installed to completely automate the process of collection of WordPress contracts using Ninja Forms and WP E-Signature.*
1. [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/)
2. [WP E-Signature](http://aprv.me/2ko4gfL) (Elite, Plus license)
3. [Stand Alone Document](https://www.approveme.com/ninja-forms-signature-special/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms) (comes with above licenses)

*A license is required and can be purchased at [www.approveme.com](https://www.approveme.com/ninja-forms-special-pricing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms)


**What would you do if you discover the contracts you used in running your online business were not legally binding?**

= Ninja Forms Digital Signature Add-On =

Imagine if you or your client were in a courtroom, only for the judge to discover that the e signature used on the contract with your client (or customer) was not signed using a compliant UETA/ESIGN e signature application? 


**The legal and electronic signature industry is a highly regulated sector which has strict laws and regulations regarding the electronic signature and transmission process. This is especially true for legal contracts, invoices, time sheets and employee agreements that could end up in a court room.**    


Ninja Forms is a terrific WordPress Form Plugin! It is quite possibly one of the best ways to automate any number of tasks using a WordPress website (and of course their renowned forms plugin). However, *signing legally binding contracts is NOT Ninja Forms primary focus* (it is however ApproveMe’s WP E-Signature  sole focus). We have invested many years building a system that adheres to the strictest [UETA and ESIGN](http://aprv.me/2lIEKSE) nationwide and foreign document signing regulations. 

This Signature Plugin fills the gap between a WordPress Forms plugin and an e-signature solution that is compliant with the UETA/ESIGN guidelines.


**How this signature add-on is different from your average signature addon**
The majority of WordPress contract plugins and digital signature add-ons out there are not legally binding much less UETA/ESIGN compliant (they fail to follow the countless laws and regulations guiding the document signing industry). These kinds of basic signature add-ons, only “record signature details when it is drawn, then they transmit this data to an online website server where the signature is converted and forever stored as a PNG (or JPEG) graphic file and finally saved on your own ftp server (forever).”


This approach exposes you and your client’s authorized signature on the ftp website server in which your WordPress website lives. **The image file of your client’s hand written legal signature (the identical signature that is used to buy a house, sign up for credit cards, purchase a car, obtain a business loan) is accessible to ALL ftp intruders; placing both you and your signer at a potential risk of identity theft.**


**ApproveMe’s brand new signature add-on found at [ApproveMe.com](http://aprv.me/2ko4gfL) it is the connection point between a WordPress forms plugin and having a UETA / ESIGN compliant contract signing application that runs on your WordPress site.**

**Check out the video clip above to find out ways to save time and money by fully automating legal contracts for your website design, digital photography, freelance or consulting business making use of our Ninja Forms Digital Signature Add-On.**


**MORE ON HOW THIS SIGNATURE ADD-ON WORKS**

**[ApproveMe’s Signature Add-On for Ninja Forms](https://www.approveme.com/ninja-forms-signature-special/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms) generates a UETA/ESIGN compliant court recognized contract with (optional) details/field values inserted anywhere you want them inserted in the contract.  These dynamic field values are taken from the submitted form of your end user.

Your form submitter can either draw or type their legal  signature using their mouse, trackpad, tablet or smartphone.  All of this magic happens the instant an end user submits a Ninja Form by either emailing a signer specific invitation to their contract or immediately redirecting the end users.**

Another highly popular use case is pre-filling contract data that might change from contract to contract. Say for instance, you are a Web Design agency and you have a standard contract you send out that varies ever so slightly every time you bring on a new client. Maybe you have optional packages available that need to be noted in your contract. But creating a new contract from scratch is incredibly time consuming.
 
With this Ninja Forms Signature Add-On + ApproveMe’s WP E-Signature  (license) you can create a Ninja Form with the fields and sections of the contract that vary and add an additional field for the “Signers Name” + “Signers Email.” 

Your Ninja Form would look something like:

DROPDOWN FIELD 1  = Dropdown of available packages
PARAGRAPH FIELD 2 = Classes or terms that vary from contract to contract
TEXT FIELD 2 = SIGNERS FULL NAME
TEXT FIELD 3 = SIGNERS EMAIL ADDRESS

You would insert these Ninja Field values in your WP E-Signature  contract in the proper places or paragraphs that pertain to this information.
 
You would choose the option “Email this contract whenever this form is submitted.”

 Now, whenever you fill out this Ninja Form, your contract will be automatically generated with the custom terms from your Ninja Form submission and then a signer invitation email will be sent to the signer email address that was given in the Ninja Form submission.


*Additional benefits of ApproveMe’s WP eSign Plugin and this for Ninja Forms Signature Add-On is that you are able to instantly create a legal contract for your clients to sign depending on their form information from a Ninja Form.*


**And that’s just the beginning. When a client signs…**


*… both you and the client will instantly get a PDF of the contract that they signed (e-signature automation at its finest).*


*…registering or sending your client to a third-party website to sign your legal contracts is not required (all signatures take place on your WordPress website… so the experience is on your site and not someone else’s)*

*… you’ll have a 100% legally compliant electronic signature on file to protect you AND the customer (according to UETA/ESIGN guidelines).*


###Ninja Forms Digital Signature add-on turns your WordPress site into a court recognized document signing application (but without the monthly fees… and with unlimited amount of users).###
 
* Ideal for anyone who wants to automate signature collection on proposals, quotes, timesheets, service terms agreements, new client legal contracts, waiver forms and much more! *

Immediately redirect your site visitors to sign a legally binding contract after submitting a WordPress Form that was created using Ninja Forms. 

“I agree to terms” checkboxes have the legal standing of a limp handshake. **Do the smart thing. Don’t get caught in a courtroom with a document that’s not legally binding.**


**ADDON FEATURES THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE**
WP E-Signature  offers an incredibly in depth e-signature add-on collection with several easy to customize [Ninja Forms e-signature automations](https://www.approveme.com/ninja-forms-signature-special/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms) and [third-party integrations](https://www.approveme.com/esign-integrations?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms) to even further improve your personalized document signing requirements.


The WordPress Online Contract platform operates on every leading PC and web browsers for smart phones. For example Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Safari, Android, iOS, and WebOS.


Besides being user friendly, ApproveMe’s Ninja Forms WordPress Signature Plugin is able to instantly enter details which was posted from a Ninja Form into a UETA/ESIGN compliant and courtroom accepted contract form utilizing your own WordPress website.


Therefore if you have a dropdown list of options in your Ninja Form named “Web Design Package” and you provide various products (different price points for each) it is possible to easily produce a legal contract which includes the package features of an order in the written agreement which is then sent to the end-user of your Ninja Form.


**Instantly Trigger Contracts To Be Sent** As soon as a client inputs data into and submits a Ninja form (that is connected to a WP E-Signature  contract using this add-on) it is possible to instantly generate a Contract to be delivered either by email or by redirecting the signer to the contract immediately as the “thank you page.”


**Connect Ninja Forms Digital Signature With WP e-signature** This Ninja Forms Signature Add-On will blend the powerful automation attributes of Ninja forms with the e-signature features and peace of mind offered with WP e-signature.


**Include Ninja Form Field Values Inside A WP E-Signature  Contract**  With WP E-Signature ’s Ninja Forms Electronic Signature Add-On, you are able to input submitted form information into a legal contract that is activated immediately as soon as a client submits a Ninja Form.


**Redirect a User to a Electronic Signature Contract after Submitting a Ninja Form**  After a user successfully submits a Ninja Form they can be immediately be rerouted to the contract of your choosing by using this E Signature add-on.


**Sends your Client a Contract Via Email Once they Complete a Ninja Form** After correctly submitting the Ninja Form, there is the option to email the form submitter a contract (or perhaps a different customer if the additional customer's email and name was in the recently completed Ninja form).


**Signing Reminder Emails** In the event that a customer has not yet electrically signed the contract which you were requesting them to sign after sending in your Ninja form, it is possible to instantly trigger signing reminder emails where you can choose the trigger date, the frequency of reminder emails, and the expiration date of the signing reminder emails.

== Installation ==

###How it Works:###


*The plugin for Ninja Forms Signature is very simple to setup. With an active ApproveMe license, it is possible to (and instantly) produce a legally binding (court accepted) contract utilizing completed Ninja Form data and require your Ninja Form submitter to add their signature on your WP E Signature generated contract.*


This plugin is amazing for Freelancers, Web Designers, Photographers and Small Business owners who want to simplify their contract generation process.


###Get started by following these simple Ninja Forms Signature Plugin setup steps ###


**Step 1:**
*ApproveMe's WP E Signature usually takes a couple more plugins/add-ons to help you release the full power and automate Ninja Forms as well as Digital Signatures that are legally binding. The following plugins are required:*


1. [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/)
2. [WP E-Signature](http://aprv.me/2ko4gfL) (Elite or Plus license)
3. [Stand Alone Document](http://aprv.me/2ko4gfL) (comes with above licenses)
*A elite or plus license is required and can be purchased at [www.approveme.com](https://www.approveme.com/ninja-forms-special-pricing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms)


**Step 2:**
*Input your ApproveMe license*
After you have bought a license from ApproveMe, you must input your license key to launch upgrades and technical support.


Log into your account to download your license key [ApproveMe account](https://www.approveme.com/sign-in/) here (your password is included in the receipt emailed to you)


**Step 3:**
*Set up a blank WordPress page*
Once the WP e-signature plugins and add-ons have been installed and your configurations saved you have to set up a blank/empty WordPress webpage for every Stand Alone Document (or contract) you will be producing/sending to your form submitters.


Discover more about Stand Alone Documents by visiting this [helpful article](https://wpe.approveme.com/article/156-basic-document-vs-stand-alone-document?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms)


**Step 4:**
*Set up a Stand Alone Document*
With the new blank WordPress page you will need to produce a Stand Alone Document and then connect that WordPress page to our Stand Alone Document.


Find out more about Stand Alone Documents by visiting [documentation page](https://wpe.approveme.com/article/137-stand-alone-documents-add-on?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms) for this add-on.


**Step 5:**
*(optional) Input Ninja Form User Details into a Contract*


This step will be different depending on the desired outcome you want. Approve Me's Digital signature is triggered once a Ninja Form is submitted. This add-on provides you with the power to incorporate Ninja Form user info (which was inputted from the customer once the form was sent in) into a brand new contract form which will either be emailed to the customer or will be shown to the customer after they submit the form.


**How to use Ninja Forms to add form fields details into a contract**


Go to the Signer Input Fields/Custom Fields symbol and choose "Ninja Form Data".


Choose the Ninja Form which you have previously made (and want to link with your contract form) using the drop down option list. 

Pick the field info you want to include in your new contract.


A shortcode is created using this data. Don't be concerned though, the real field value that your customer inputs is going to be shown instead when they sign your contract. 


This is an example of the auto-generated shortcode which will get placed in the document you are producing when you select your desired field value from your Ninja Form. 


[esigNinja formid="3" field_id="1" ]


It is easy to transfer the shortcode that is created instantly, anyplace in your contract form and it is going to show the customer's provided info anywhere the shortcode is found in your contract.


**Step 6:**
*Select your document preferences and save settings*


When you have inserted all of your required contract text and have linked your preferred Ninja Forms field data to your Stand Alone Document, you will be ready to choose/define your document settings. 


Please Be Aware: Before you can post your contract form, you also have to link your Stand Alone Document with the blank WordPress webpage you made previously for your contract. Do this by looking for and choosing the webpage from the "Display on this page" drop down option list found under the "Document Options" area. We decided NOT to include this page in your nav menu since it will be connected to a Ninja Form and will not work properly unless it has the field values of that submitted Ninja Form.


**Step 7:**
*Getting there... you're half way done*
When you've published your Stand Alone Document you are halfway done. In the next step you have to pick your "trigger" and "action" selections for this document in Ninja Forms. 


Select LET'S GO NOW! to establish those final Ninja Form preferences.


**Step 8:**
*Finalize creating the Ninja Form workflow/trigger*


You're very close to the end now! All you need to do is to select your contract along with the your preferred actions once the workflow is activated. 


Go to the "Forms" tab located in the WordPress control panel. 


Select the form you attached to the Stand Alone Document. 


Choose the "E-Signature" choice within the form options and specify the remaining options. 


Now You're done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Can I collect legally binding court recognized Digital Signature from my WordPress website when someone submits a Ninja Form? =

With the Ninja Forms Signature Add-on by ApproveMe, along with a [WP E-Signature ](https://www.approveme.com/ninja-forms-signature-special/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms) license you can easily collect [UETA/ESIGN compliant](https://www.approveme.com/ueta-and-esign-act?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms) signatures from your visitors or website customers after they submit a Ninja Form on your website.

**You can even pass details from the submitted Ninja Form into your WordPress contract or document.**

= Are Digital Signature Legal? =

Yes, electronic digital signatures are legally binding in the United States and many countries around the world.  **United States** in the US there are two digital signature Acts that established the legality of digital signatures in the US – the [Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Signatures_in_Global_and_National_Commerce_Act) (ESIGN, 2000) and the [Uniform Electronic Transactions Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Electronic_Transactions_Act) (UETA, 1999). Both the ESIGN and UETA establish that electronic records and signatures carry the same weight and legal effect as traditional paper documents and handwritten signatures, they say “A document or signature cannot be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.” The ApproveMe WP E-Signature  plugin is UETA/ESIGN compliant.

**United Kingdom**
In the UK, similar legislation to the ESIGN Act in the USA was likewise settled in 2000, and is known as the UK Electronic Communication Act. 

**European Union**
The appropriation of the European Directive 1999/93/EC of 13 December 1999 established a the utilization of electronic marks on electronic and digital contracts inside of the European Union (EU). Thirty European nations (EU-27, Croatia, Turkey and Liechtenstein) have officially adopted Directive 1999/93/EC. To that end Electronic and Digital marks are effectively being used in Europe, and ApproveMe’s compliant WP E-Signature  plugin is legitimately acceptable and enforceable within the European Union.  One of the best ways to ensure your document is EU compliant is to utilize our “Send Custom Contract Invitation via Email” feature.  So when a user submits your Ninja Form they will be emailed a custom email invitation to sign their unique contract.

= Will I Need to Renew my ApproveMe License? =

Yes you will (unless you have an Ultimate License). Each license key is valid for one calendar year from the purchase date. An active license key is needed for access to automatic/critical updates, plugin support and access to our growing [e-signature add-on library](https://www.approveme.com/wpesign-features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms).  

= Where Can I Find My License Key? =

If you’ve already purchased a license key and need to retrieve the license number, you can do that on the [support site here](https://www.approveme.com/profile/) or follow [these detailed steps](https://wpe.approveme.com/article/140-installing-wp-digital-e-signature?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms). Once you’ve successfully logged into the support site (using the credentials emailed to you at the time of purchase), your active license key(s) will be listed at the bottom of the page.

= What do I get with my ApproveMe license =

Your license grants you access to all of our support resources, documentation, product downloads and basic and advanced add-ons like Stand Alone Documents, Document Templates, Unlimited Sender Roles and others, (which are required for this Ninja Forms Wordpress e-signature Plugin) for one calendar year from your purchase date.

[You can get a license here](https://www.approveme.com/ninja-forms-special-pricing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ninja-forms)

= How much does it cost to renew my license? =

The Ultimate Plan does not have a renewal cost.  It is a one-time payment for the WP e-signature plugin.  However all other plans have an annual renewal.  Our goal has always been to pull the price back as much as we possibly can so small businesses and freelancers could sign documents electronically using their WordPress website (and save alot of money in the process). Not only is our plugin the most powerful of its kind, it’s also the most affordable.  Not to throw anyone under the bus, but look at what our competitors charge every single year:

Adobe charges $1,080 / yr (per 3 users)
Docusign charges $1,440 / yr (per 3 users)

Not charing for renewals would actually hurt the product as we would not be able to invest as heavily as we currently do back into it...

= What do I get for renewing my license? =

Renewing your license provides an additional year of support and software updates. This provides peace of mind knowing you can turn to us for WP Electronic Signature related support and assistance. You’ll also continue receiving software updates to ensure WordPress compatibility (and security) as well as great new features and enhancements! Also (depending on your license) as we release new basic and premium add-ons you will be able download these at anytime.

= Where do I go for help on additional pre-sale questions? =

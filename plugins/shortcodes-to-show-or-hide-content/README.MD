### Welcome to the GitHub Repository

This plugin provides shortcodes allowing you to display content or hide content at given dates and times. You can also combine the two to show some content at a given time, and then hide it at another time.

There's also a separate shortcode if you want to repeat a schedule for showing and hiding content - for example to only show information about a radio show while it's on air.

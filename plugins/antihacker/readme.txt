==Why disable the  WordPress xmlrpc==
This plugin disables XMLRPC API in WordPress 3.5+ or above, which is enabled by default. 
XMLRPC on WordPress is actually an API or “application program interface“. 
It gives developers who make mobile apps, desktop apps and other services the ability to talk to your WordPress site.
Most users don’t need WordPress XMLRPC functionality, and it’s one of the most common causes for exploits. 
If you want to access and publish to your blog remotely, then you need XMLRPC enabled. 

==Why should we disable pingbacks?==
Pingback allows you to notify other bloggers that you have linked to their article on your website.
A WordPress website with Pingback enabled can be used in DDOS attacks against other websites. 
An attacker can exploit pingback functionality through simple command and an XMLRPC request. 

==Why disable Json WordPress Rest API==
(disable WordPress Rest API)
**Block User enumeration to improve security.**

The REST API (new WordPress 4.7) allows for anonymous access and this means that anyone can list all 
the users of a website. This will enable botnets to try and Bruteforce attack a website with the user’s credentials. 

==Brute Force Login Protection ==
A **brute-force attack** is an attempt to discover a password by systematically trying every 
possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until you discover the one correct combination 
that works. 
Our plugin will **protect your site against Brute Force Attack**, by restrict access to login page to 
whitelisted IP addresses. 
Otherwise, your login page will request your wordpress user email. 
It is not necessary Limit Login Attempts. Read below about Rate Limiting.

==Rate Limiting==
Rate Limiting is a substitute to **Limit Login Attempts**.
Bots and Hackers can make a lot of visits in a short time period.
We can just limit a number of visits.

==Simple Login Lockdown==
Rate Limiting is a substitute to **Simple Login Lockdown**. Read above.

==Rename wp-login.php==
Rate Limiting is a substitute to **Rename wp-login.php**. Read above.

Add users and members to AWeber lists based on their membership level.

== Description ==

Add users and members to AWeber lists based on their membership level.

This plugin offers extended functionality for [membership websites using the Paid Memberships Pro plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/paid-memberships-pro/) available for free in the WordPress plugin repository. 

With Paid Memberships Pro installed, you can specify unique lists for each membership level.

The settings page allows the site admin to specify which lists to assign for all users and members to plus additional features you may wish to adjust. The first step is to connect your website to AWeber using your account's authorization code.

== Installation ==
This plugin works with and without Paid Memberships Pro installed.

= Download, Install and Activate! =
1. Upload the `pmpro-aweber` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Navigate to Settings > PMPro Aweber to proceed with setup.

= Configuration and Settings =

**Authorize your app with AWeber:** Your Authorization Code will be provided once the app is authorized with your AWeber account. Navigate to Settings > PMPro AWeber in the WordPress dashboard to authorize your app with AWeber.

After entering your Authorization Code, continue with the setup by assigning All User Lists, Membership Level Lists, and review the additional settings.

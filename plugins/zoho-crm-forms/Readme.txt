== Description ==

Websites are one of the most important sources of leads for your business. That means your CRM system should be well integrated with your website to contextually capture each and every visitor to turn them into a lead.

Introducing the Zoho CRM Lead Magnet plugin for Wordpress. This lets you create webforms, embed them in your website, and automatically capture leads directly into your CRM with zero attenuation.

Not only is the integration easy to set-up but it's also easy on your wallet.

== Installation ==

1. Install the Wordpress plugin from Wordpress Marketplace. Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory or install via the Add New Plugin menu.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. Once you activate your Zoho CRM forms plugin, you'll be asked to authenticate access from Zoho CRM. To do that, simply  enter the username and password of your CRM account.

The plugin installation is now complete and the integration between Zoho CRM forms and Wordpress is established.

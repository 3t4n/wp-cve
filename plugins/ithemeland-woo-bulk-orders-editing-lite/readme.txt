== Description ==

<a href="https://ithemelandco.com/plugins/woocommerce-bulk-orders-editing/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=web_links&utm_campaign=user-lite-buy"><strong>WooCommerce Bulk Orders Editing Plugin</strong></a> is a useful extension for managing and bulk edit WooCommerce orders in a robust and flexible way. With this plugin, you can professionally manage the data of your woocommerce e-shop made with Wordpress.

If your store has a large number of orders, it becomes difficult to edit and update as well as manage those orders individually.

This Bulk Edit plugin helps to do the bulk editing task easier with a lot of bulk editing options and support for any order related properties.

<strong>Why is WooCommerce Bulk Orders Editing plugin useful?</strong>
<h4>&#9989;&nbsp;Saving your time: </h4>
<ul class="elementor-price-table__features-list">
	<li><strong>Managing and editing a large number of orders easily</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Changing order status for several orders at same time</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Search and filter specific orders</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Bulk edit of values for billing and shipping fields</strong> One the important sections of each orders is the billing and shipping fields area. They allow your customers to set their billing and shipping details and help manager to control orders based on billing and shipping fields. For example, Billing First Name, Billing Last Name, Billing Phone, Billing Email, Shipping First Name, Shipping Last Name, Shipping Phone, Shipping Email and …</li>
	<li><strong>Bind editing:</strong> With this option, you can set the same value of edited orders to all selected orders. This will help you edit several orders at once and will result in a faster editing and save a huge amount of your time!</li>
	<li><strong>Delete multiple orders:</strong> You can also delete multiple orders simultaneously with just one click. You can delete any number of orders by order status, category of order item, order items, price fields, billing and shipping and etc… and basically any filter conditions.</li>
	<li><strong>Duplicate orders:</strong> Some time you need to have a copy of one or group of orders, you have to add new orders and set fields as other order’s fields one by one, that is a boring task. With Duplicating Orders option, you can select desired orders and duplicate them, rather than duplicating each order one by one.</li>
	<li><strong>Save search queries for later use:</strong> You can save the most used search queries for later use (or any search query you want). This way, you don’t have to choose the search options every time, and with just two clicks you can use your most used search queries to find the orders you need. </li>
</ul>

<h4>&#9989;&nbsp;Easily scale-up online store: </h4>
<ul class="elementor-price-table__features-list">
	<li><strong>Adding or editing orders in a short time</strong> For example, if you have orders specific details, it is a difficult task to update all details of orders. This Bulk Edit plugin helps to do the bulk editing job easier with a lot of bulk editing options and support for any order related properties and fields.</li>
	<li><strong>Import and export any orders according to your requirements</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Make a customized column from your orders</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Use a spreadsheet to control, manage and edit numerous orders at the same time:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>View all your order simultaneously</li>
			<li>Edit orders easily</li>
			<li>Create a lot of orders at once</li>
			<li>Copy information between orders quicker</li>
			<li>Actions coulumn: There is an important column in the woocommerce default order list as the Action column. WooCommerce Bulk Orders Editing supports this column too, for example, if you install a third-party plugin to generate a PDF invoice for each order, a new icon will be added to this column in order list to generate the invoice. WooCommerce bulk orders editing plugin add this icon in action column too and you can generate your invoice easily.</li>
			<li>And more…</li>

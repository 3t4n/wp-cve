# Editor Theme Options

Allow editors to access theme options in the Appearance menu.

## Description

Simply put: this plugin gives the Editor role access to edit "theme options", which includes:

* Appearance > Widgets
* Appearance > Menus
* Appearance > Customize if they are supported by the current theme
* Appearance > Background
* Appearance > Header

Instead of adding this capability by hand on each client site, just install and activate this pluginâ€”it keeps your `functions.php` file clean, and keeps this type of functionality where it belongs.

The capability is added to the role once (on plugin activation) and removed when the plugin is deactivated.

## Installation

1. Upload `editor-theme-options` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or search for "Editor Theme Options" under Plugins > Add New and click "Install Now".
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu.

## Questions

### Why the Editor role, and why this capability?

Editor access to widgets and menus is, by far, the most requested change I've had of this nature. I've seen similar sentiments.

### Why not use a role editor plugin?

Those work, too! They're just quite robust, and this is for a specific role and capability.

### Does this work with Multisite?

It should. Please let me know if it doesn't.

### Can I change the role or capabilities affected?

There aren't any filters or anything like that. If you know how to `apply_filters`, then you can fork the plugin and have it do what you need.

Each Contact Form 7 contact form has its own Redirect and Thank You Page settings.

#### Thank you Page Feature 
When a contact form is set to use the Thank You Page and the user submits the form,  it will send the Contact Form 7 email as usual, then redirect the user to the Thank You Page. This Thank You Page is not an actual "page" on your site, this means that form specific data can be shown on this page and it won't be shown to any other users or indexed by search engines. The Pro version of this plugin allows you to show user specific data on the Thank You Page.

#### URL Redirect Feature 
When a contact form is set to redirect to a URL and the user submits the form it will send the Contact Form 7 email as usual, then redirect the user to the URL specified.

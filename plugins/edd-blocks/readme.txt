== Description ==

EDD Blocks adds a "Downloads" block to the new WordPress editor, also known as Gutenberg.

The Downloads block allows you to display a grid of Downloads on your site similar to the [downloads] shortcode already provided by Easy Digital Downloads. The Downloads block provides a visual representation of your downloads, allowing you to see a real-time preview of your downloads as you configure the various settings.

As well as being able to display downloads, a grid of Download Categories or Download Tags can be shown.

Gutenberg also provides a shortcode block so we've added a [download_categories] and [download_tags] shortcode. Each shortcode shares the same attributes, mimicking the options of the Downloads block:

**thumbnails** 

true (default) | false

Whether or not to show the thumbnail image.

**title**

true (default) | false

Whether or not to show the category or tag name.

**description** 

true (default) | false

Whether or not to show the category or tag description. 

**show_empty** 

true | false (default)

Whether or not to show empty terms.

**columns**

1 | 2 | 3 (default) | 4 | 5 | 6

The number of columns.

**count**

true (default) | false

Whether or not to show the number of downloads in each term.

**orderby**

count (default) | id | name | slug

What to order the terms by.

**order** 

ASC | DESC (default)

In which order to display the terms.

"ELFI Masonry" is a filterable and gallery showcase addon for the Elementor page builder. Creating showcases for portfolios, posts, and products with Elementor

== Description ==

"ELFI Masonry" is a filterable and gallery showcase addon for the Elementor page builder. With this addon, you can create showcases for portfolios, products, or post items. And set a category-based filter button.

You get two widgets in this ELFI addon. One is Filter Masonry and the other is Gallery Masonry. 

Filter masonry will be created based on post type and the category will act as a filter button. On the other hand, gallery masonry will be created from the Elementor editor page. Gallery items can be created using custom images.

**Filter Masonry Widget**

Filter Masonry is a widget that allows you to create filters based on categories. Suppose you have created a filter for products in the showcase. Now select the category that will be used as the filter button and the products will be displayed category-wise. That is, when a filter button is clicked, that category item will be displayed.


**Gallery Masonry Widget**

Gallery Masonry is a widget that allows you to create showcases by displaying custom images. It doesn't depend on the post, you add custom images from the Elementor editor page and create the gallery showcase.



= Features of Filter Masonry = 

**Post Type Based**: The filter masonry works based on, post type. With this plugin, you can create filters for product filters, blog post filters, portfolio filters, and custom post types.


**Two Type Sorting**: Filter masonry will have two types of sorting systems. 
1) Category: Selecting this will have the option to show category-wise items. Filters will have buttons.

2) Post-type-wise: Selecting this will display all category items under that post. There will be no filter button.


**Category Filter**: The category filter is to create a showcase with items according to category. In this case, all the posts or items under the category you have chosen will be automatically displayed. Category names will act as filter buttons



= Features of Gallery Masonry = 

**Add multiple items**: One item at a time can be added to the gallery as often as needed. This means you can add as many image items as you want to a gallery item. You can manage gallery items from the Elementor editor panel. It is not post-type dependent. So you can create an attractive gallery showcase for your site by adding the required items

**Add Title and Custom Image**: One image can be set for each item. Besides, a title/text can be added for each item. When you click on the zoom icon, you will see the title and associated link with the image.

**Add Item Link** Hovering over each item will display a link icon. Custom URL can be input in this link button

**Popup Elements**: Hovering each item will show an icon that will show popup content, here you can insert a popup image, popup video link, popup shortcode content, popup HTML elements

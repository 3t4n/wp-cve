*This is a draft of the acceptable ads policy*

## Acceptable ads in WordPress plugins and themes

Plugins and themes show banners or other sorts of notifications to users to inform them of important things that affect the usage of the plugin and theme in questions.

However, many plugins are:

* Asking for reviews.
* Informing users of discounts and asking them to upgrade to a "Pro" version.
* Asking users to enter their email to subscribe to a newsletter or get discounts.
* Asking users to enable invasive analytics that sends information about their site to the plugin creators.
 
These notifications are generally not useful or desired for users. It can also cause confusion in end users that do not understand why they need to buy, rate or sign up for something.

The types of notifications that are described above are being removed by Clarity.

### Notifications of the type outlined above should:

* Be shown only on an option page that belongs to the plugin and theme, and nowhere else.
* Be shown only to Administrator role users.
* May not be intrusive or distracting.
* Should not be displayed in the main column, but rather in an "aside".

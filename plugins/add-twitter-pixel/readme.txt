Twitter pixel plugin allows you to install your Twitter pixel properly on your website to track conversion & maximize ROI with your Twitter ads

== Description ==

Twitter is the world's third largest social network, with 320 million active monthly users and Twitter is also the [best ad platform](https://neilpatel.com/blog/twitter-advertising/) you'll find! Compared to all other advertising platforms, whether your goal is website conversions or Twitter engagement, you only pay when people take that action.

= Why You Should Consider Advertising on Twitter =
On average, Twitter users shop online 6.9x a month, while non-users shop online just 4.3x a month. And there's particularly good news for smaller businesses: Twitter reports that [60% of users](https://business.twitter.com/basics/grow-and-engage-your-follower-base) purchase from an SMB.

Beyond direct conversion, Twitter is a popular resource for customers along the purchasing funnel. Nearly half (49%) of female Twitter users say Twitter content has influenced their purchase decisions ---- while only 7% have made a purchase through Twitter. On the other hand, [17% of men](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-trends/) reported in a BigCommerce survey that they'd purchased something directly from a Tweet in their timeline.

The data speaks for itself: Twitter is prime real estate for brands wanting to increase conversion, revenue and social proof (e.g., customer reviews via social media). The advertising platform represents a wide variety of interests and demographics, and is particularly relevant for college-educated audiences under 50. Some [36% of Twitter users](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/social-media-update-2014/) visit the site daily, with 22% saying they go on Twitter several times a day.

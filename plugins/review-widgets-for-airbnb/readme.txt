For a start, the widget allows you to showcase your best Airbnb reviews which provide social proof for your company. The more positive the reviews are surrounding your business, the more likely it is that you’ll be able to attract more customers.

Showing off reviews is essentially a form of free marketing that every business should capitalize on. You don’t have to pay exorbitant amounts of money, and yet the return can be great.

### Why are Airbnb reviews so important?

Airbnb user reviews are important to a business in the hospitality industry as they tell travelers whether or not the accommodation provided offers good value for money.

So if collecting more Airbnb user reviews could potentially boost your sales, how do you go about getting more of them from your customers?

One of the best ways to secure more user reviews is to solicit them through emails or social media pages. There’s a right and wrong way to go about this of course, but provided you explain to the customer how important it is to the success of your business that they leave a review, you should have success with this approach.

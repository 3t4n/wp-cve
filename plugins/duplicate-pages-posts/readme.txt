Duplicate pages, posts and custom post types with all their settings and contents with a single click.

== Description ==
This Plugin lets you duplicate posts, pages and every other custom post type. Lightning fast and with only one click. The clone will contain all your content and every setting. It will be duplicated as a draft.
There are two ways to duplicate:

* Go to the dashboard and hover over the post you want to duplicate and click „duplicate"
* When editing a post or viewing it in the frontend click „duplicate" in the admin bar

Cloning works for posts created with Gutenberg or the classic editor as well as with page builders. All the content, the categories, tags, featured image and every setting will be duplicated to a new post that is saved as a draft.
The plugin does not have any settings, it works right out of the box.

Facebook is one of the most widely used social media platforms, and as such, it’s an excellent place to extract reviews for your business. The power of Facebook recommendations is very high, but you’ll need a widget in order to display them on your website and persuade new customers to give your business a go.

This widget is ideal for small and large businesses alike and comes with various designs so you can customize it to fit the profile of your company website. There are 40 widget types and 25 pre designed widget styles, so you can show off glowing customer reviews in a way that best suits your marketing approach.

### Facebook Reviews Wordpress Plugin

It is an easy-to-use plugin that you can use to take your business to new heights.

Well, with a widget such as this one, you can drum up more business by proudly displaying top customer reviews in a prominent part of your website. This can build social proof, which in turn can help breed customer loyalty and inspire visitors to convert their interest into action.

Why show Facebook reviews?

Facebook is a hugely popular social media platform with millions of active users. This makes it the perfect platform to leverage for marketing purposes, since your customers will likely leave reviews on your business page. Once they do, you’ll be able to display them on your website and even in other mediums such as email to boost your conversion rate and build social proof.

To ignore the benefits of free marketing in the way of Facebook reviews would be naive, since the impact they can have on a business can be profound. In this day and age where online reputation means everything to a company’s success, being seen in a positive light is imperative.

If you don’t yet have any Facebook reviews, that’s not a problem. We recommend that you try to collect them by driving traffic towards your Facebook business page and kindly requesting that customers leave reviews. You can do so by providing a link to the page in your email correspondence to customers, or by posting on your website or social media, letting them know how their reviews and feedback help you grow the business.

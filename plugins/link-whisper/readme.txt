Quickly build smart internal links both to and from your content. Additionally, gain valuable insights with in-depth internal link reporting.

== Description ==

Are you interested in a faster and easier way to build internal links? If so, Link Whisper is a tool that can help you gain the value of powerful internal links without having to manually build them.

## SMALL SUGGESTIONS, BIG RESULTS
Link Whisper quietly and quickly “whispers” contextual internal link suggestions that can both help your readers better find content on your site and helps Google rank your site better due to the improved link structure.

Google, Moz, Search Engine Land, and even Bing knows that internal links are important. Link Whisper helps you take what was once a time-intensive chore (that gets even bigger as your site grows) and turns it into an opportunity for you to have a better-optimized site than your competitors.

## AUTOMATIC LINK SUGGESTIONS AS YOU WRITE
Links Whisper is smart. Powered by artificial intelligence, Link Whisper starts suggesting relevant internal links when you start writing your article…right within the WordPress editor.

Depending on how many articles you have on your site and the relevance of your existing content, Link Whisper will suggest dozens or more internal links from the content you are editing.

Just copy the link suggestion and then paste where suggested. Internal links done.

**Don't want to have to copy and paste links or worry about creating anchor text? ** [Try the Premium version of Link Whisper](https://www.linkwhisper.com) to get a much more hands-off experience.

## INTERNAL LINKS REPORTING
Ever wondered if you have any “orphan” content out there that doesn’t have a single internal link built to it?

With Link Whisper you can quickly see which pages have very few or no internal links pointing to them.

In addition to the number of links pointing to a given post, the reports page also shows how many outbound internal links and external links are coming from each article.

Want much more in-depth reporting?  In Link Whisper Premium you get full internal link error reporting; including broken links, 404 errors, and much more.  Plus you have the ability to quickly fix or remove those broken links right from within Link Whisper.

[Check out Link Whisper Premium right here.](https://www.linkwhisper.com)

## CUSTOMIZE INTERNAL LINKS SUGGESTIONS AND SETTINGS
If you want to fine-tune the link suggestions for your site, you have that capability.

Within the settings, you can ask link whisper to ignore certain words or phrases in order to get the optimal linking opportunities for your site.

Want to open all internal links in a new tab? No problem! Link Whisper has an optional setting for that.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What Kind of Link Suggestions Can I Expect? =

Link Whisper suggests link based on the content of your site. In other words, it finds relevant connections that are related. These in-content, relevant links are the most powerful type of internal link there is.

You are in complete control to either accept or reject the link suggestion.

= What if I Want to Remove Links After I Make Them? =

Internal links added with Link Whisper act just like any other link on your site. You can remove the links within your editor, just like you would any other link.

= What if I Uninstall the Plugin, What Happens to All My Links? =

All your links will remain active, even if you uninstall the plugin! Once you add internal links to your site, they are just like any other link. They are “permanent” links that will only be removed if you want them to (even if you stop using Link Whisper…which we hope you never do!).

= Will Link Whisper Help Me Rank Better in Google? =

Link Whisper is ideal for bloggers, niche site creators, and anyone with a content heavy website. The more content you have on your site, the more powerful Link Whisper becomes.

= What is Required to Use Link Whisper? =

Link Whisper is a WordPress plugin. So, all you need is a self-hosted website that has WordPress installed.

= What if I Don’t Like the Link Suggestions I’m Getting? =

Remember, you can customize the settings to fine tune the types of links are suggested. You can set certain words and phrases to be ignored if certain suggestions are coming up too much.

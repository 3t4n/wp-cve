== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want to style the badge myself, how do I remove the default styles =

There are only a couple of styles applied to the badge. Although not best practise it's probably safe to just overwrite these with your own css. However, if you want to do it properly you can either dequeue the css:

`
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'remove_new_badge_styles', 30 );
function remove_new_badge_styles() {
	wp_dequeue_style( 'nb-styles' );
}
`

Or use the filter:

`
add_filter( 'woocommerce_new_badge_enqueue_styles', 'remove_new_badge_styles' );
function remove_new_badge_styles() {
	return false;
}
`

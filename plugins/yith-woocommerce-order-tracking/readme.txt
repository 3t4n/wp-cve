Add an easy tool to manage order shipping information of your shop and to notified your customers about the shipping.

== Description ==

Usability research revealed that 97% of customers expect to be able to monitor every step of the shipping process for the products they have purchased online.

Thanks to the free plugin YITH WooCommerce Order & Shipment Tracking, you can add the shipping information (carrier's name, delivery date, tracking code, carrier's site URL to track the order in real time, etc.) to every order and show the same data on your customers' accounts (both in the orders list and order details).

Giving users a tool to monitor the product shipping will simplify the sale process, will strengthen their trust in your shop, and will reduce the workload (phone calls, emails, etc.) of your customer service.

= Free options =

* Set a default carrier for your shippings
* Enter the tracking number, carrier’s name, and pickup date in the order detail page
* Show the tracking info on the user’s Orders page
* Show the tracking info on the Order details page
* Choose the position of the tracking info text on the Order details page (above or below the products table)
* Show a button to redirect customers to the carrier’s page containing details of the shipping

= Features of the premium version =

The free version of our plugin works like a charm, but the premium one is even more interesting.

By upgrading to the premium version, you can:

* Get a list of 480+ supported carriers to automatically share the tracking URL with your customers
* Also enter the estimated date of delivery
* Save time by importing tracking info from a CSV file
* Share the tracking info via email with customers when the order is completed
* Choose the position of the tracking info text in the email (above or below the products table)
* Choose to automatically complete the order when inserting the tracking data
* Use the shortcode to create a custom order tracking page on your shop
* Enable an extra column in the orders list with the orders tracking info
* Insert the tracking data into the packing slips generated with the premium version of YITH WooCommerce PDF Invoices & Packing Slips
* Integration with the premium version of YITH WooCommerce Custom Order Status to show order tracking data in Custom Order Status emails
* Integration with YITH Frontend Manager for WooCommerce
* Use the plugin's shortcode in the Elementor panel

2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.

== Screenshots ==

1. General options: enter the default carrier name and customize the text to show in the user's My Account Page. Placeholders will be automatically replaced with the Carrier's name, Pickup date, Tracking code and Carrier's link inserted in the order.
2. Order editing: enter the tracking info in the order. You can set the Carrier Name and website URL, the tracking code and the date when the order item(s) have been picked up by the carrier.

4. Customer view in orders list: the customers can view the shipping info of each order directly in the list of orders, inside the My Account page. By clicking on the button, they will be redirected to the Carrier's website (the URL entered by the admin in the order).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I always use the same carrier to ship my WooCommerce orders, may I set it as default carrier? =

Yes, sure, you can set the carrier name in the settings of YITH WooCommerce Order & Shipment Tracking and for each new WooCommerce order you will find the field "carrier name" automatically filled with your default carrier.

= Can I customise the message I want to send to customers? =

You can set your own text for your WooCommerce orders using the specific option available in YITH WooCommerce Order & Shipment Tracking. You can also use some optional placeholders to specify carrier's name, tracking code and shipping date.

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YIThemes, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days.

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!

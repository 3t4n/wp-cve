[Update to PRO here](https://houzezpropertyfeed.com/#pricing)

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* Houzez theme installed and activated
* For formats that use XML the PHP SimpleXML library will need to installed
* That WP Cron is firing automatically or an alternative cron job in place
* For formats that send or receive files via FTP the PHP FTP functionality will need to be available

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you donâ€™t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Property Hive, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Houzez Property Feed" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the Houzez Property Feed plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

Once installed and activated, you can access the import tool by navigating to 'Houzez > Import Properties' from within Wordpress.

= Updating =

Updating should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Screenshots ==

1. Once activated you'll be presented with a new 'Import Properties' admin menu item where you can manage your imports
2. Existing automatic imports will be displayed along with scheduling information
3. Adding and editing imports is easy with our simple to use interface
4. Each time an import runs we'll store in-depth logs so you can see exactly what was imported and when, plus any errors that arose

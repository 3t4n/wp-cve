FAQ

1. Where can I change the settings?
There are no settings; the plugin adds functionality to the media screens.

2. When I stall the plugin I get the following error "unexpected T_CONST, expecting T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR or ‘}’"
This is because your using PHP4 and this plugin only works with PHP5

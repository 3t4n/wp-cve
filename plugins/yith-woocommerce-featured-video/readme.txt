YITH WooCommerce Featured Video allows you to place a video in the product detail page instead of the featured image.

== Description ==

YITH WooCommerce Featured Video plugin is an extension for the WooCommerce plugin that allows your users to see a YouTube or Vimeo video instead of the featured image of the product detail page.
Add the URL of YouTube or Vimeo video in the specific field of the product configuration page and your customers will have the pleasure to watch something dynamic and cutomized.

For a more detailed list of options and features of the plugin, please read the [official documentation](https://yithemes.com/docs-plugins/yith-woocommerce-featured-audio-video-content/ "YITH WooCommerce Featured Video official documentation").

= Languages =
Also available in:

* English
* Italian

= Installation =

Once you have installed the plugin, you just need to activate the plugin in order to enable it.

= Configuration =

YITH WooCommerce Featured Video will add a new submenu called "Featured Video" in "YIT Plugins" menu. From here you can configure all plugin settings.
You will be able to add your video in your products following these steps:

1. Open the configuration page of the product where you want to set the featured video;
2. Set the URL of video in the "Featured Video URL" field, in the "Product Data" box.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Featured Video` from Plugins page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What should I add in the product configuration? =
You have to simply set the URL of the video, for example "http://vimeo.com/67175696" or "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDTWsuyFYRM"

= What are the main changes in plugin translation? =
= Translation issue with the  1.1.2 =
Recently YITH WooCommerce Featured Video has been selected to be included in the "translate.wordpress.org" translate programme. In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'yit' to 'yith-woocommerce-featured-video'. Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org. During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in: yith-woocommerce-featured-video-.po yith-woocommerce-featured-video-.mo. For example, if your language files were named yit-en_GB.po and yit-en_GB.mo, you will just have to rename them respectively as yith-woocommerce-featured-video-en_GB.po and yith-woocommerce-featured-video-en_GB.mo.

= Is the plugin compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YIThemes, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new s are Released on, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days.

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin , your theme  and your WordPress and WooCommerce  (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce s you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!

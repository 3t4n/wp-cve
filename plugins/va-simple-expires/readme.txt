== Description ==

VA Simple Expires is a plugin that allows you to add an expiration date to posts.
The usage is pretty simple. You define an expiration date to a post and when the date comes, the post is removed from the public side of your site and set to "expiration". "Expiration" is a new post status added by the plugin.

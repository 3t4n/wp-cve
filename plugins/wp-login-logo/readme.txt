This plugin is a simple, lightweight WordPress plugin to change your login logo.

== Description ==

View the plugin page for more information and discussion: [http://workstation.nerdnet.it/portfolio/wp-login-logo/](http://workstation.nerdnet.it/portfolio/wp-login-logo/)

WP Login Logo is a simple plugin I made so that I could customise the login screen on my own website by utilising in-built WordPress functions and the WordPress media uploader.
Considering all the bloated plugins and resource intensive implementations floating around, I thought this lightweight codebase and clean UI could be of similar benefit to other WordPress users/developers.

Don't expect too many fancy bells and whistles, this plugin does one thing, and does it well.

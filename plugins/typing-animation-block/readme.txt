A Gutenberg block to render a typing animation or typewriter effect.

== Description ==

You can use the block inside the Gutenberg editor as you would use a headline block. You can find it in the common section. You can change the text that appears in the animation in the editor (Number 1 in the screenshot). The different sentences are separated by a pipe (|). You can format the text by using `<i>...</i>` for italic or `<b>...</b>` for bold text. To change the underlying element that is used in the html of the page (h1 to h6 or span) there is a dropdown menu in the block toolbar(Number 2 in the screenshot). In the block panel you find different options to customize the speed, looping and other options of the typing (Number 3 in the screenshot). The underlying library used is Typed.js. You can find more information in the [repo](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js)

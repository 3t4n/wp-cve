How to install Searchanise plugin


Before the installation, please check the version of your WooCommerce plugin. You can find it in your Wordpress admin panel in Plugins > Installed plugins. If it’s 3.0.0 or higher, you’re good to go.


You can install Smart WooCommerce Search by Searchanise in 2 ways - a simple one and an advanced one.

Installing Searchanise through Wordpress admin plugin upload (simple)
1. Log in to your Wordpress admin panel.
2. Go to Plugins > Add new and click Upload plugin at the top.
3. Browse and select the smart-search-for-woocommerce.zip archive you have downloaded.
4. Click Install now and wait a second.
5. Click Activate plugin as the installation is done. Indexation of your store has started.
6. Now you can go to Products > Searchanise to start setting up the plugin you installed.

Installing Searchanise manually through FTP (advanced)
This method is a bit harder than the previous one. You may need it in case your provider has file restrictions that could prevent you from installing a plugin from the admin area. This is what you should do:
1. Extract the downloaded archive to your computer. You’ll get a folder named smart-search-for-woocommerce with a bunch of files in it.
2. Open the FTP client on your computer and access your website with FTP/SFTP credentials. If you don’t have any, contact your hosting provider to obtain them.
3. Go to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory of your website and upload the folder you extracted at step 2 there.
4. Log in to your Wordpress admin panel.
5. Go to Plugins > Installed plugins and find Smart WooCommerce Search by Searchanise. It’s already there!
6. Activate the plugin and the indexation starts.
7. Now go to Products > Searchanise and start setting your new plugin up.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


**How many keywords can I add?**

You can add up to ten different keywords with the free WordPress plugin. If you need to track more keywords you can use Wincher.com

**How many websites can I add?**

The plugin will only track keywords for the site you installed the plugin on. You can however install the plugin on all your WordPress sites and connect it to the same Wincher account, but this is only possible for our paying subscribers. Users with multiple websites will probably have a better experience using Wincher.com

**What search engines does Wincher support?**

At the moment of writing we support 93 different Google search engines all around the world.

**My Google result does not match Wincher’s result. What is wrong?**

A couple of things can cause this difference. The most common reason is that Wincher collects ranking in incognito mode. This means that the particular search engine is not trying to give you a better result depending on your location or previous search queries. Another common reason is that Wincher collects ranking only once a day for each keyword and that rankings can change during the day.

== Upgrade Notice ==

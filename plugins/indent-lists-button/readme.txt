Indent all lists! This plugin adds an indent button to the WordPress editor for indenting lists.

== Description ==

= Why this plugin? =

In WordPress it's not possible to indent lists. The regular indent button is greyed out after selecting a bullet list or numbered list. This plugin offers a solution to this problem.

= How to use this plugin =

Install and activate the plugin. Now, in the WordPress editor, select the list that you would like to indent. Click on the new "Indent List" button in the editor. Your list will indent. Rejoice in the fact that both text and list are well aligned. This only works if the lists are not already indented or somehow blocked by fancy layout of a theme. See [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indent-lists-button/screenshots/) for details.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire indent-lists-button folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory or download the plugin via the Plugins section of the WordPress admin.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Open a page or post in the WordPress admin and check if a new button has appeared in the editor-bar. The new button should be located on the second row of the editor buttons next to the normal indent/outdent buttons. If the second row is not visible, click the Toolbar Toggle button.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= In which Wordpress themes does the problem to indent a list occur? =

In all themes. Some themes (notably Twenty Fifteen and Twenty Sixteen) align lists at the same level as the surrounding text (see [the first screenshot](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indent-lists-button/screenshots/)), in which case it can be quite annoying that you cannot choose to indent lists.

= Isn't there simply an alignment-code I can use to indent a list? =

Yes, there is, but it requires knowing and applying the basics of html and css. And we think this button is the most easy way to indent a list.

= Does it also work with numbered lists? =

Yes, it does.

= Is it possible to undo the indentation of the list? =

Yes. You can undo the current indentation by clicking the Indent List button again.

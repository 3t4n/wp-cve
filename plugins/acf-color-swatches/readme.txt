== Description ==

An add-on for Advanced Custom Fields to allow users to select from a list of color choices. Setting up the field works exactly like setting up a radio button list, the main difference being that the key will also be used to style the element. 

This is useful for allowing users to pick from a limited selection of colors, rather than enter an arbitrary hex value or choose from a color picker. 

Supports all of the following color formats: 

*   hex: #FF0000
*   rgb: rgb(255,0,0)
*   rgba: rgba(255,0,0, 1)
*   hsl: hsl(0,100%,50%)
*   hsla: hsla(0,100%,50%, 1)
*		name: red

Note: you may also use `none` to show a transparent swatch with a checkerboard background.


== Compatibility ==

This ACF field type is compatible with:

*   ACF 4
*   ACF 5 (PRO version)


== Screenshots ==

1. Use the same syntax as defining ACF radio buttons
2. Users will see color swatches that act like radio buttons

== Installation ==

1. Make sure to have [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/ "ACF") plugin installed.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Use the plugin while creating custom fields

== Installation ==

After downloading the ZIP file,

1. Log in to the administrator panel.
2. Go to Plugins Add > New > Upload.
3. Click "Choose file" ("Browse") and select the downloaded zip file.
4. You can control what columns you would show in variation table from WooCommerce -> Variation Table.

Once you have installed and activated the **Product Variation Table for WooCommerce - PVT**, your product variation has a new tabular look with the default plugin settings. You will find a new menu option under WPXtension. Hover over or click on WPXtension to find the new menu option called Variation Table (***WPXtension > Variation Table***).

Access the menu to make desired customizations to the default plugin settings.  First of all, under the settings tab you have the option to control where you want to place the variation table on the product page. Secondly, you have the option to select the columns for your product variation table. You can include the following options: *Thumbnail, SKU, Description, Attributes, Dimensions, Weight, Stock, Price, Quantity, Action*.

How much would you love to reposition the columns of your variation table! Apart from enabling or disabling specific table columns, you can also reposition them as you wish. The drag and drop option offers perfect flexibility to reposition the table columns. Additionally, on the right-hand side, there are up and down arrows to move a table column in your desired direction.

Next, you have the option to show or hide the Available Options button. You can customize the text from Available Options to anything you want. Furthermore, you can change the Cart button text from Add To Cart to something more meaningful for your store or customers.

Under the *Layout* tab, first of all, you will find the Element Settings section. The Quantity Field Layout gives you the option to add +/- input to increase or decrease product quantity in the quantity field. **Note:** this feature requires theme support so if it does not take effect for you, do not bother. Next, you can set a scroll to the top of the page when a product is successfully carted. Finally, you can choose to display a Cart Confirmation Notice when a product is successfully added to the cart. Another new option is the subtotal column. Including this tab will show instant price changes when the quantity field is updated.

*Table Customization Option* is the next section to give you more visual control of the table. You will find the option to control(show/hide) the table header for your Product Variation Table. With the *Stop Table Breakdown* option, you can choose the table layout for mobile devices. So can either set the table to breakdown on small devices or display them just like the large screen devices. Next comes *Horizontal Scrollbar* to give your customers proper browsing ability to check complete product details.

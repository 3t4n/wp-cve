### Flexible Refund and Return Order for WooCommerce in a nutshell

Flexible Refund and Return Order for WooCommerce is a plugin you need when you want to handle return and refund requests directly in your store.

The plugin helps you to add a refund form and allows your customers to request an order refund or return directly from the My Account page. Also, communicate about the WooCommerce refund with a customer by using refund request order statuses, notes, and emails. Add a privacy and refund policy (or terms and conditions) checkbox for users to accept to proceed with the refund for WooCommerce orders. Define conditions for returns and warranty requests in WooCommerce with the form fields and description.

The PRO version will help you handle the refund process automatically by setting conditions for refund button visibility, managing partial refunds, enabling auto refunds, hiding the refund button after some time, and choosing a new refund type (on WooCommerce coupon). You may also let customers upload a file for returns and warranty requests. Moreover, add a link to the privacy and refund policy page and your WooCommerce terms and conditions.

== Installation ==

You can install the plugin like any other WordPress plugin.
1. Download and unzip the latest release of the plugin.
2. Upload the entire plugin directory to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in the WordPress Administration.

You can also use WordPress uploader to upload the plugin zip file in WordPress menu Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin. You can find and install the plugin through your Plugins menu with a search bar too.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I use this plugin to manage a WooCommerce refund? =

After installing the plugin, enable the refund button in the plugin settings. You may also add a refund form with fields for your customers like text, textarea, checkbox, radio, and select with description, CSS class, and additional field settings. You can describe your refund and return policy and show your customers additional information for the refund form.

Refund buttons will become visible for your customers on the My Account page of their accounts for their orders.

You will find refund requests in your WooCommerce -> Refund Request menu. You'll be able to send the message and decide about the refund (and change its status) in the Order Edit screen.

So, the Flexible Refund and Return Order for WooCommerce plugin will help you manage refund requests and communication with your customers!

= What are the differences between the Flexible Refund and the built-in WooCommerce refund options? =

By default, WooCommerce lets you process the refund manually. After you receive the call or an email from a customer, go to the *WooCommerce &rarr; Orders &rarr; Edit the order &rarr;* and use the Refund button below the product list.

If you want to speed up the refund and returns process and do not miss any calls or emails from your customers, use  Flexible Refund and Return Order for WooCommerce. The plugin makes refund requests easier for your customers and yourself! You will manage all order refunds under the *WooCommerce &rarr; Orders* menu.

The plugin lets you add and customize the refund form, communicate with customers, and process the refund in WooCommerce!

= Can I allow customers to ask for a shipping costs refund? =

Yes. You can enable that option in the plugin settings. The plugin will allow your clients to ask for a refund for the whole order.

Customers can select specific items for a partial refund in the PRO version of the plugin.

[**Upgrade to PRO &rarr;**](https://www.wpdesk.net/products/flexible-refund-and-return-order-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=flexible-refund)

= When to use the plugin? =

The plugin works for WooCommerce orders. It will help you manage refund and return requests in WooCommerce better. You can also add a refund form to ask for more information about the refund or reasons for a product return.

The automatic email notifications will shorten communication and support.

You may also choose the conditions for refunds, enable auto refund, hide the refund button after some time, handle partial refunds, and choose an automatic WooCommerce coupon refund type in the PRO version of the plugin.

[**Upgrade to PRO &rarr;**](https://www.wpdesk.net/products/flexible-refund-and-return-order-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=flexible-refund)

= What are the benefits of Flexible Refund and Return Order for WooCommerce? =

The plugin is easy to configure and start using!

You will no longer have to handle the refund and return requests by phone or email. Your customers will be able to ask for a refund from their accounts.

You can adjust the refund form by asking to accept the checkbox of your WooCommerce terms and conditions, or privacy and refund policy. And there is even more automation, new settings, new form field types, partial refunds, and priority support in PRO if you need additional speed.

= Can I allow users to request and withdraw their refund requests from one place? =

Yes. The refund button will appear on the My Account -> Orders page for those orders that are appropriate for the refund. Your customer will be able to request a refund and fill out the form directly there. So, no need to call or mail you outside WooCommerce.

If customers change their minds, they cancel the refund request for the WooCommerce order in the same place!

= Can I condition the refunds, returns, and warranty requests? =

Yes. You may add a checkbox to accept the privacy and refund policy. You can do similarly with your WooCommerce terms and conditions.

Also, by setting the conditions for the refund button in the PRO version of the plugin, you may show it only for some orders. You may autohide the refund button after a specified time too.

[**Upgrade to PRO &rarr;**](https://www.wpdesk.net/products/flexible-refund-and-return-order-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=flexible-refund)

= Can I add privacy, refund policy, and terms and conditions with the plugin? =

You may add a checkbox in the refund form. Also, inform about the privacy and refund policy in your WooCommerce store with a field description. In the PRO version of the plugin, you can use the HTML form field to add links. For example, to terms and conditions or your WooCommerce refund policy page.

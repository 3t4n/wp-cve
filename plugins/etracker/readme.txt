etracker analytics plugin for WordPress adds GDPR-compliant cookie-less and opt-in-free tracking.

== Description ==

This plugin is the easiest way to use [etracker analytics]( https://www.etracker.com/?etcc_cmp=eA%20Plugin&etcc_med=Pluginstore&etcc_grp=wordpress&etcc_ctv=plugindescription ) for your WordPress website or your WooCommerce shop.

[etracker analytics]( https://www.etracker.com/?etcc_cmp=eA%20Plugin&etcc_med=Pluginstore&etcc_grp=wordpress&etcc_ctv=plugindescription ) enables web analytics without data loss due to lack of consent, blocking add-ons or browser tracking protections. Thanks to data protection-friendly processing in harmony with GDPR and eprivacy regulation, maximum data quality is achieved!

The plugin integrates the tracking code into your website. This automatically measures page views, scroll and download events, videos and clicks on external links. In WooCommerce shops, the following eCommerce events are also automatically sent to etracker: Product (detail page) viewed, added to cart, removed from cart and orders.

For third-party tags, the integrated tag and consent management is the practical all-in-one solution for managing consent easily and triggering them conveniently and in compliance with data protection regulations. Google Consent Mode is supported by default for Google tags.

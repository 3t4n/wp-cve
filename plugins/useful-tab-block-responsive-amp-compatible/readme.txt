Useful Tab Block adds responsive and AMP-compatible tab blocks to your Gutenberg editor.

== Description ==

## Everything in Gutenberg
You no longer need to "register" your tabs used only on a single page.

* Maximum number of tabs: 10
* You can customize:
   * **Label background** color (checked/unchecked)
   * **Label text color** (checked/unchecked)
   * **Label shape** (rect or round)


## Responsive
Depending on the screen size, Useful Tab Block automatically adjusts the tab size. You do not have to be worried about how to style tabs.

## AMP-Compatible
Useful Tab Block does NOT use JavaScript in the frontend, which makes it AMP-compatible. Besides, that makes it possible to render and function tabs faster.

## Premium Version

In the premium version, four additional functionalities are provided:

* Rearrangement of tabs
* Fontawesome icons in tab labels
* Add/remove tabs more easily and intuitively
* Custom colors for label texts and backgrounds

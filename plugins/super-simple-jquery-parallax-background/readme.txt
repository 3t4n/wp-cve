For themes with background images, creates a parallax effect when scrolling. Super simple; no configuration. Just works.

== Description ==

*Super Simple jQuery Parallax Background* enables a parallax effect with your theme's background image. Just set a background image in your theme's "customize" options (optionally setting it to "fixed" position) and activate this plugin. Done. "It just works."

It relies on jQuery, which comes with WordPress and is probably built into your theme. Tested and works with the "Twenty Twelve" theme out of the box.

Looks best with seamlessly-tiling background images.

== Installation ==

1. Use the "Install Now" option from the WordPress Find/Add plugins admin page, or Upload the `super-simple-jquery-parallax-background` folder (with it's contents, of course) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

It enables a very lightweight bit of javascript on your pages. Using jQuery, it watches for scrolling on the page, and makes the background scroll slower than the content.

= Why doesn't it look *awesome*? =

How it looks depends on the background image used, and your theme. It works well with themes like Twenty Twelve, where content bits have their own opaque background color. I also suggest using a background image that tiles seamlessly.

= Where can I get support? =

While I will do my best to honor inquiries about this plugin, I did not release it with the intent to support it. This plugin is to be used at the user's own risk and I may not always be able to respond to inquiries or continue updating the plugin on a regular basis. The actual methods employed by this plugin are relatively "simple" in nature, and almost any WordPress or web developer should be able to help you out, in my absense. Use the fine forums provided by WordPress to seek help.

== Screenshots ==

Parallax is an animation effect, and is hard to show in a static screenshot. Check out the included `demo.html` file.

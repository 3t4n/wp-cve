* added: support for downloading everything from a gallery all at once
* added: stylesheet to force HR to behave nicely in common themes ("Finally!" so say we all)

* changed: select all button now toggles between selected and unselected
* changed: JavaScript now loaded as external script, not part of gallery template
* changed: process download action through admin-post.php, no need for AJAX logic (still supported for legacy customised templates)

* fixed: undeclared variable warning when number of columns set in Gallery settings

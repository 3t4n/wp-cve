= Benefits of Social Comments =

1. **Virality**: When people comment at your blog using their Facebook, Disqus accounts, the comment not only shows up at your blog, but it also appears in their news feed. This puts your blog in front of new audience which further adds to the likelihood of you getting a new returning visitor.

2. **Higher Conversations**: When you know the person commenting on something, it's more likely that you will also type out your ideas there, unlike the situation when you don't know the person involved in the conversation.

3. **Credibility**: In traditional comment form, anyone can put any fake name (Bruce Wayne ..... ;)) to comment on your blog. If the same comment is from the original Facebook account of the person who is commenting, you can give credibility to this user and also the people will automatically trust it.

4. **No Spam**: You can get rid off the spammers and users, commenting using their fake accounts.

5. **Works for the lazy**: Most people are nowadays lazy. To get these people commenting on your blog, it will just require them to login to their Facebook account (which almost everyone does after powering ON computer).

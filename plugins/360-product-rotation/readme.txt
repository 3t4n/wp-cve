Turn a series of product photos into an interactive 360 degree view.

== Description ==

####Works in 3 steps ####
1. Create a 360 view with the [online 360 view creator](https://www.y360.at/creator/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_content=readme_creator) (requires registration)
2. Enter your license key in the plugin settings page
3. View your created views in the 360 media gallery and copy and paste the short code to embed it in any page/post.
4. Optionally, manually upload your self-hosted 360 view to wp-content/uploads/yofla360/ directory and embed it using a short-code

####Features####
* Full 360Â° view
* Responsive design
* Works on mobile devices (retina support)
* Works with Woocommerce (storefront theme tested)
* Cloud or Self Hosted option

== Installation ==
* Install 360 Product Rotation Plugin by installing from your Wordpress Admin area
* Enter your license key in the 360 plugin settings page
* View the 360 views you created with the online creator in the media gallery, copy the shortcode and use it in any page/post

####Shortcode parameters####
* **src** is the reference to the cloud-based 360 view (or for legacy players, path to local 360 view)
* **width** is your desired width in px or % (optional parameter, defaults to 500px)
* **height** is your desired height in px or % (optional parameter, defaults to 375px)
* **auto-height="true"** if set to true, automatically resizes the height of the 360 view on small screens to keep its aspect ratio

== Screenshots ==
1. This is how the player looks like. It is possible to customize the theme (buttons)
2. Web-based interface for creating 360 views (external website)
3. List your projects in Wordpress, copy & paste shortcode (authorization using license key is required)

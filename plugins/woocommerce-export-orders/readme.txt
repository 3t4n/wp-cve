WooCommerce Export Orders

== Description ==

**What's new**
With version 1.1.0 export Customer Billing Email and Phone along with the other information.

**[Woocommerce Export Orders](https://imaginate-solutions.com/downloads/woocommerce-export-orders/)** enables store managers to export the itemized list of the products for all the orders.
Order status columns has been added since version 1.0.0.

A new semantic UI look has been added since version 1.0.0 to improve the user experience of the reports 

The report can be exported in CSV, Excel and PDF format.

Reports can be copied and pasted elsewhere along with headers and also directly printed.

Moreover since version 1.0.0 we have removed the usage of flash which we were previuosly using since flash is going to be discontinued in the near future.

== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce Export Orders, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce Export Orders” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

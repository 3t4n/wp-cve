This plugin adds MoreNiche specific code to your website. Once you activate the plugin your website
will have the soft pixel code installed.

== Description ==

Soft pixel is a revolutionary new way of tracking visitors across the MoreNiche network.

Before activating this plugin on your site, please ensure you have added your domain through your affiliate dashboard on [MoreNiche App](https://app.moreniche.com). You will need to sign in to the app and go to **settings** > **domains** and follow the instructions to get started.

Once you activate the plugin, the pixel will call mixi when someone visits your page, sending only the referrer information. When sales are placed, MoreNiche will use this information as part of their sales attribution models.

This plugin makes it easy to add deposits like "bottle deposit" (German: Flaschenpfand) to WooCommerce products.


== Description ==

*Dieses Plugin ermöglicht es, jedem Woocommerce Produkt Pfandwerte zuzuweisen und somit Dinge wie Flaschenpfand abzubilden. Deutsche Übersetzung liegt bei. Für Anpassungen bitten wir um [Kontaktaufnahme](http://www.nerdissimo.de/).*

This plugin was written for a German beverage store. They needed deposits for bottles as well as boxes, which would be displayed separately and excluded from tax calculation.

With this plugin you can add a deposit to any WooCommerce product by adding the price under `Products - Deposit Types`.

**Note:** Because WordPress allows users to add multiple values and
comma-separate them, you have to input the prices with '.' (period) as the decimal separator, independent of WooCommerce settings.


== Features ==

* Translation-ready (German translation included)
* Uses built-in functionality of WordPress and Woocommerce thus fully compatible with, e.g. WP Export/Import tools
* Developer-friendly (more hooks & documentation to come)


== Custom code ==

Since there are a lot of different ways you or your customer may want this set up, please contact us for customizations such as:

* Compatibility with WooCommerce German Market (disable taxing off deposit)
* Link deposit to shipping zones' methods or customer language
* Force sells (e.g. 1 beer crate for every x bottles)
* Enabling of tax calulation

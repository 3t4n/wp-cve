**WPC Name Your Price** provides two types of pricing choice: enter a number in the box within/without min & max prices. Users can also define the steps for pricing in the corresponding box. By default, if you leave min/max/step box blank or enter 0 value, then these options will be disabled.

Notably, decimal values are acceptable for Select type. So if you’d like to set decimal prices like $2.50, $3.75, $12.95, etc., this is the right choice. As for this type, users should enter a price value on each line or use a price range to create predefined prices. With this, sellers can easily take control of the price while still offering customers the freedom to choose a favorite price value. This is the most remarkable feature of WPC Name Your Price, which is unavailable to any other plugins of similar kinds.

Note: By default of WooCommerce settings, users have to put a number in the General tab of the Product Data section in order for the Add to Cart button to be enabled. This price is not the actual price and won’t be counted into the total.

In addition, it’s possible to customize the suggested price, minimum price and main text for Name Your Price by entering the text in the respective box. To hide these text, simply leave these boxes blank. Everything you need to customize this plugin is straightforward with clear instructions in the settings. To set the general default options for price on the whole site, navigate to admin dashboard > WPClever > Name Your Price.

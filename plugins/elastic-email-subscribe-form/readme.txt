**How Elastic Email Subscribe Form works?**

Elastic Email Subscribe Form replaces WordPress default `wp_mail()` function by using API integration with Elastic Email to send an outgoing email from your WordPress installation. Thanks to this, you can track all the parameters of your delivery, use Private IP addresses to get full control over your sending IP address, maintain reputation and delivery, and secure your data better than ever. But that is not all! Elastic Email Subscribe Form is also a widget you can further personalize to your needs. It’s compatible with almost every other plugin and you can also integrate it with reCaptcha v2 for additional security. Simply drag and drop the widget to the appropriate area to enable it on your page. You can also have more than one widget on your page, add, remove and edit the lists, and decide in which list the acquired emails should land. All of that without leaving your WordPress dashboard.

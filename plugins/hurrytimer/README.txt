Create unlimited urgency and scarcity countdown timers for WordPress and WooCommerce to boost conversions and sales instantly.

== Description ==

[HurryTimer](https://hurrytimer.com/) is a multi-purpose countdown timer that allows you to create urgency and scarcity that drives clicks, increases sales, and highlights upcoming events or deadlines.

Use HurryTimer to create:

**Evergreen campaigns:**
Give each visitor their own unique countdown timer regardless of their local timezone and the moment they visited your site.

It's a great way to boost conversion by creating a feeling of scarcity, urgency and exclusivity.

**One-time Campaigns:**
Run a campaign between two fixed dates. No matter who visits your site the countdown timer is the same. It's a great way for event-based sales with a firm deadline.

**[PRO] Recurring campaigns:**
Recurring campaigns are self repeating countdown timers that run according to a set of rules. 

It's great way for telling customers about shipping cut-off times to get them to checkout faster. 

You can schedule minutely, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly recurrences.

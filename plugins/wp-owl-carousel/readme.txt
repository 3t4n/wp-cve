== Installation ==
Go to your Wordpress Dashboard. From there select Plugins -> Add New. Search for \'WP Owl Carousel\', make sure it found the right plugin and click Install Now.

Alternatively, extract the zip file and upload the contents to the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the plugin from the plugins page.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to control when and how this plugin's assets get loaded? =

First you'll need to tell the plugin not to enqueue the assets.

For all files:

`add_filter('wp_owl_carousel_enqueue_assets','__return_false');`

For individual files:

`add_filter('wp_owl_carousel_enqueue_css','__return_false');` - Owl Carousel css

`add_filter('wp_owl_carousel_enqueue_theme_css','__return_false');` - Owl Carousel Theme css, loaded after the main css

`add_filter('wp_owl_carousel_enqueue_owl_js','__return_false');` - Owl Carousel minified javascript, loaded after jquery

`add_filter('wp_owl_carousel_enqueue_plugin_js','__return_false');` - Plugin's own javascript, initializes the carousels, depends on plugin's JS

And now just use the 'wp_enqueue_scripts' action hook and wp_enqeue_script/wp_enqueue_style functions somewhere in your code.

There's also the get_wp_owl_carousel_url() function to easily get this plugin's url if you don't want to copy the assets over somewhere.

###How AfterShip Returns users win:
- **Recapture revenue with exchanges**
Improve shopper satisfaction while recovering return revenue with variant or incentivized other-item exchanges and AI-powered product recommendations.
- **Reduce operational costs**
Automate processes and minimize return-related support tickets by centralizing returns, setting routing rules, and leveraging an analytics dashboard.
- **Improve the returns experience**
Increase brand consistency and drive repurchases through fully customizable, branded returns pages, proactive notifications, and embedded navigation.

*"This exchange feature took every problem away. It’s also saved a lot of revenue — saving us $125k in the last 90 days. Historically, those would have just resulted in a dead refund. That amount will only keep going up as we get more and more returns."*

**Nikolas Callas, Director of Operations**

###What users can accomplish with just one integration:
- **Sync order data directly from WooCommerce**
Centralize return requests and processing with a branded returns experience and an end-to-end management dashboard. Automatically approve returns and allow customers to pull order data directly from WooCommerce for faster request submissions.
- **Automate processing via conditional workflows**
Use non-returnables, allowlists, and customizable return windows to enforce return policies and set expectations. Accept and route returns globally via built-in reverse logistics, supporting label generation, boxless drop-off, and in-store returns.
- **Encourage exchanges with AI & incentives**
Offer one-click variant swaps and other item exchanges to reclaim revenue and boost shopper satisfaction. Leverage Al-powered product recommendations and incentives, including bonus credits and free shipping, to encourage exchanges.
- **Customize & brand the shopper experience**
Fully brand return pages while automating status notifications to inform shoppers and reduce customer shopper strain. Integrate multi-language support and your WooCommerce store's navigation integration to reach more shoppers and build consistency.
- **Leverage analytics for data-driven decisions**
Track and export data on an intuitive analytics dashboard, including at-a-glance info from common return reasons to exchange revenue. Leverage insights to optimize return processes, measure product performance, and speed up product development.

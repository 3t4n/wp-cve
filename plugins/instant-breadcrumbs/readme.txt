Instant Breadcrumbs adds a breadcrumb trail to your WordPress blog's primary navigation menu. No theme editing required!

== Description ==

Instant Breadcrumbs adds a breadcrumb trail to your WordPress blog's primary navigation menu. No theme editing required!
Including a breadcrumb trail on your site not only makes it easier for visitors to navigate your site, but also allows
search engines to better explore your blog and include the breadcrumb information in rich snippet data in search
results. Many breadcrumb plugins exist, but normally require either theme editing, or use of a theme that is already
customized to include the breadcrumb function. In addition, editing the theme is usually followed by some CSS
styling to make the breadcrumb trail match the overall 'look' of the site.

Instant Breadcrumbs takes a different approach. Since breadcrumbs are a navigation aid, the generated trail is
automatically added to the front of your existing primary navigation menu. This allows it to not only function
straight out of the box with a large number of themes, but also use the existing styling of your primary navigation
menu.

A quick overview of Instant Breadcrumbs features:

* Works with both custom primary menus and the default 'page' menu generated by WordPress;
* Produces RDFa-compliant breadcrumb trails that may be used by Google and others in search results;
* Supports customization of the breadcrumb titles for pages such as the front page, archives, and search;
* Re-uses existing top-level entries in the primary menu to avoid repeated links;
* Includes CSS classes for added breadcrumbs for optional further styling if desired;
* Use the built-in breadcrumb generator, or third-party generators such as Yoast ([WordPress SEO][yoastseo])
  and [Breadcrumb NavXT][navxt], adding those to the nav menu without theme editing. Tested against
  Breadcrumb NavXT 5.1.0 and WordPress SEO 1.5.4.2;
* Supports HTML markup in post titles, with the option to disable it;
* "Manual" mode allows insertion into templates for themes that do not use the WordPress primary navigation menu;
* A widget is available if you would prefer to show the breadcrumb trail in a sidebar.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload the `instant-breadcrumbs` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory;
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress;
1. Optionally change settings values in the 'Breadcrumbs' settings page, listed under 'Appearance';
1. If using a supported breadcrumb plugin as generator, customize that plugin settings;
1. Optionally add custom CSS, although the plugin is designed to work without theme editing;
1. If your theme does not have a primary navigation menu, insert `<?php instant_breadcrumb(); ?>` into your theme.
   You may pass optional HTML as a first parameter to separate items, and pass `true` as a second parameter if you
   wish to return the result rather than write it directly to the page. It is strongly recommended that you perform
   your own CSS styling in manual mode;
1. If you prefer, you may include the breadcrumb trail in a widget. Go to the 'Widgets' submenu (under 'Appearance' in the
   WordPress admin) and drag the Instant Breadcrumbs widget to the appropriate position. You may set a title and optional
   separator HTML. As above, it is recommended you apply your own CSS styling.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which themes does the plugin support? =

Instant Breadcrumbs is designed to work with "generic" WordPress blog themes. In other words, these
are basic themes which have a header that calls `wp_nav_menu` in their header to include a
menu (or a menu based on your static pages, if no menu has been defined). The default themes that
ship with each WordPress installation are good examples, as are most "general purpose" blogging
themes. The plugin is intended to provide easy breadcrumb functionality for basic blogging, and will
attempt to identify the first menu on the web page.

= Breadcrumbs are not showing, or are in the wrong menu? =

Instant Breadcrumbs attempts to find the first menu in your theme, and add the trail there. For some
themes the menu may be difficult to identify, or the first menu is not the ideal position. In these
cases, you may manually specify a theme location in the Instant Breadcrumbs settings. The value here
should match the `theme_location` in the relevant `wp_nav_menu` call in your theme header. Leave this
blank to allow Instant Breadcrumbs to automatically find the first one.

If your web site is highly customized, and your theme contains its own custom code to generate
menus or navigation, then it's likely that Instant Breadcrumbs may not be called when your site
is displayed. In this case, you can revert to theme editing and call `instant_breadcrumb()` manually
to insert the breadcrumb trail at an appropriate location in your theme. You can optionally insert
HTML between the breadcrumb elements, and you should perform your own CSS styling. Alternatively,
you may insert the supplied widget in an appropriate location.

= I don't want the breadcrumb trail automatically adding itself to my menu. =

The automatic addition of breadcrumbs to the main menu is not for everyone. It may not suit your
existing menu items, or perhaps you would prefer a more traditional breadcrumb display somewhere
else in your layout. The automatic mode is the default in Instant Breadcrumbs, but you may disable
it in the Breadcrumbs settings page (under Appearance). If you are using the widget method, or
manually editing your template PHP, it is recommended you disable automatic mode.

= Will settings remain if I upgrade the plugin? =

The plugin is designed to keep your settings from one installed version to the next. If the upgraded
version has new settings, they will be set to sensible defaults. You should verify these new settings
after an upgrade. Your old settings should still be preserved.

= My home page appears twice in the modified menu? =

Instant Breadcrumbs will reuse menu items wherever possible, for example when viewing a page that is
already in the top-level menu. However it cannot reuse a menu item link if doing so would mean the
generated breadcrumbs are no longer in order. The usual example of this is if the home page already
appears in the primary menu. The generated breadcrumb trail requires the home link to be first. The
easiest workaround for this is simply to customize your menu so the home page is not included a
second time.

= How can I apply custom CSS to the added breadcrumbs? =

The Instant Breadcrumbs plugin adds the CSS class `ib-crumb` to the `li` element of any breadcrumbs in
the menu, and `ib-lastcrumb` to the last link in the breadcrumb trail representing the current page.
Furthermore, the class `ib-added` is added to the `li` element of new menu items created by the plugin,
and `ib-edited` to existing menu items. These may be styled in your theme's `style.css` should for
instance you would like breadcrumb items to be highlighted in a different color.

Some useful examples: `.ib-crumb {display:inline;}` will display your breadcrumb trail in a single line
if you are using PHP or the widget to display the trail. A more complex one is `.ib-crumb+.ib-crumb:before {content:">";}`
which will add the additional arrow as a separator between consecutive breadcrumbs.

= Why do HTML characters such as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; appear incorrectly in the output? =

If your post title includes these characters, be sure to escape them correctly (for example
as `&lt;`, `&gt;`, and `&amp;`). Otherwise they may be rendered incorrectly at any time they may appear on the Web
page, including in the breadcrumb trail. This is nothing particular about Instant Breadcrumbs, but all
breadcrumb generators, and Web pages in general, behave similarly. As of version 1.2, you may include HTML markup in
your post titles, such as `<em>for emphasis</em>`, and the Instant Breadcrumb trail will optionally
include it in the breadcrumb as well. This option is enabled by default. Disabling it will use
text only in each crumb.

== Screenshots ==

1. A screenshot of Instant Breadcrumbs generated on a blog post in TwentyFourteen, showing the
breadcrumb trail for the current post, including the post category. This is without any theme editing;
2. The exact same blog in TwentyTwelve, no theme editing;
3. ... and in TwentyThirteen, again without theme editing;
4. The same page in TwentyFourteen on a smaller display, showing the breadcrumb trail automatically
styles with the navigation menu;
5. The breadcrumb trail for a page that already appears in the nav menu, reusing the existing link.

== Troubleshooting and common issues ==
* If the shortcode is not working, then be sure that if absolute path is used to display the image, the the path  should begin with https:// on most servers instead of http:// - and the image is ok to load
* Make sure that the image path between the quotation marks is not converted to link when editing the page or post. Be sure that the path is a plain text - and the image is ok to load.

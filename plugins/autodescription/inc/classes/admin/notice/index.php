 * Some people say, "Give the customers what they want."
 * But that's not my approach.
 *
 * Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do.
 * I think Henry Ford once said, "If I'd asked customers what they wanted,
 * they would have told me, 'A faster horse!'"
 *
 * People don't know what they want until you show it to them.
 * That's why I never rely on market research.
 * Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.

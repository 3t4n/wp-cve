Add a product catalog to your site with blocks or shortcodes. Works with WooCommerce or standalone. Flexible and customizable, works with any theme.

== Description ==

Product catalog plugin that is a fully responsive and lets you showcase your products in a sleek and modern layout. 
Comes with a powerful feature set and is easy to customize. 

<a href='https://www.etoilewebdesign.com/ultimate-product-catalogue-demo/'>Product Catalog Demo</a>

<em>This catalog plugin includes <strong>Gutenberg blocks</strong> as well as <strong>shortcodes</strong>, so you can display either your whole catalog or just individual products on any page, no matter which page editing system you are using. We also <strong>include several patterns</strong>, so you can integrate your products and catalog directly into your block-based theme.</em>

= Key Features =

* 3 product catalog layouts that can be dynamically viewed and switched by the user with no page reload.
* Powerful product catalog filtering and sorting system, including for categories, sub-categories, price and product name. All handled in real time with asynchronous requests, so no page reloads. 
* Dynamic product catalog search that works with the filtering, so your customers can quickly find exactly what they're looking for. 
* Set sale prices for products, and easily toggle sale prices on and off for the entire catalog or individual products.
* Organize your product catalog into categories and sub-categories to make searching and filtering products easy.
* Includes extra blocks (and also widgets for legacy support) to add a product catalog search field as well as to display recent products, a product list or random products anywhere on your site.

<em>The Ultimate Product Catalog is very user friendly and comes with a walk-through that runs automatically when you activate the plugin and will help you create your first products and catalog!</em>

The plugin comes with several features that will help you to offer a great experience for your customers and visitors. These include the ability to set up a product catalog overview page, which shows a thumbnail of each product category and lets people click through to view just those products, a separate block (and shortcode) to display a list of featured products (instead of the whole catalog), a price slider for filtering, different sale modes and much more!

`[product-catalogue id="X"] or [product-catalog id="X"]
`

Simply insert the <em>Display Product Catalog</em> block or either of the shortcodes above (replacing the "X" with the actual ID of your product catalog) to add a product catalog with filters to any page.

It's easy to modify the styling of your product catalog with custom CSS, which will help it to further fit with the look of your site. We provide a list of the most common classes from our plugin, as well as an exmaple of how to implement custom CSS, <a href="https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-product-catalog/user/styling/css">in our documentation</a>.

It's the perfect solution to create a product catalog for your store, agency, art gallery, restaurant and more!

= Additional Features =

Some other great features included with the Ultimate Product Catalog plugin are:

* Catalog overview mode, showing category or sub-category images (such as brands, etc.).
* Choose currency symbol and location.
* Price slider that lets you filter the catalog for products that match exact price criteria.
* Easy-to-use block and shortcode attributes that let you set a starting layout, exclude layouts, hide the sidebar, etc.
* Make use of URL parameters to load the product catalog with a specific category already pre-selected.
* Thumbnail support option, which displays a smaller version of your product image, to help with catalog page load times.
* Easy-to-use and comprehensive settings page, which makes it easy to customize product catalog features.
* Several different breadcrumbs options for your product catalog.
* Social media sharing options.

The Ultimate Product Catalog is also a great solution for those who are running affiliate stores, in which you link out to products for sale on other sites. With the ability to specify a unique link for each product (using the "Product Link" field), you can insert your affiliate link and then set it up so that, when someone clicks on a product in your catalog, they are brought to that link instead of the product page in the plugin. You get all the benefits and functionality of the Ultimate Product Catalog while being able to sell as an affiliate.

= WooCommerce Product Catalog Integration (Requires Premium) =

<a href='https://www.etoilewebdesign.com/ultimate-woocommerce-catalog/'>WooCommerce Catalog Demo</a>

The premium version offers full WooCommerce product integration, allowing you to sync all your products between the product catalog and your WooCommerce shop, and also allowing your customers to check out directly from the catalog.

* WooCoommerce Sync: Ultimate Product Catalog products are exported to WooCommerce and WooCommerce products are imported into the catalog.

* Choose to display the number of items in the cart directly on all product catalog pages.
* Choose to have the products in your catalog link directly to the WooCommerce product pages, for ultimate flexibility and customization.

Combining the Ultimate Product Catalog with WooCommerce will allow you to create the perfect ecommerce catalog or e-commerce store to sell products. You will now be able to have advanced WooCommerce products filters in a customizable product catalog, with all the checkout and ecommerce capabilities available in WooCommerce.

The Ultimate Product Catalog is also a great option for those running a mobile shop or mobile store and who are concerned with the responsive aspects of their mobile ecommerce. Our wide array of catalog page and product page styles are all responsive and, by combining the Ultimate Product Catalog with your WooCommerce products, you can have a responsive store that looks great on desktop and as a mobile store.

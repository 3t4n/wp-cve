== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes. The FREE TraceMyIP subscription level that provides only basic essential information and features is completely free. Additional data storage space, enhanced visitor email alerts, and advanced GEO tracking and GDPR control options are available for premium subscriptions.

= How TraceMyIP plugin is different from other website statistics services? = 

* **TraceMyIP** has been around since year **2008**! It has been a trusted and reliable service that supports its users and relies on user feedback to stay consistent with feature demands. 
* **Individual visitor** surveillance. Observe the behavior of any given visitor over time, view changed IPs and browsing patterns.
* **No inflated stats**. Ever noticed how your current statistics show plenty of visits to your site but you can rarely see actual continued interest in your content, very few conversions/purchases, or contact requests? This is because, on some sites, **over 80%** of logged visits are actually bots, scripts, and content scraping mechanisms that forge real visitor activity to gain access to the content.  As a result, it provides you with a false sense that your website attracts real people to read the content. TraceMyIP on the other hand blocks and filters the majority of content-scrapping mechanisms and bots, providing you with a more accurate picture of the amount of real people browsing your site.
* **Email and console sound alerts**. Get notified via email and console when a specific person visits your site and get sound alerts whenever there's a new visit to your website while using your TraceMyIP console
* **No major interface modifications**. We keep the interface consistent with a design that has been stable for over a decade and is based on user feedback. This prevents our users from avoiding never-ending interface changes that cause additional learning curves, reduce productivity, and cause headaches. Once you learn TraceMyIP, you will not need to completely re-learn it again anytime soon. Stability is the key to productivity.
* **No spam** and your account information is never sold or shared with third parties. Your account information, email address, and IP address remain private. You will only receive your TraceMyIP account notifications to the email address provided. TraceMyIP is proud to be a spam-free service!

= How many websites can be tracked with TraceMyIP?= 

A single user account can track up to 95 websites simultaneously at the same time in real-time. All websites can be organized in groups with an easy site search function to quickly locate an active website project.

= What kind of alerts can I set up for the visits? =

**There are 2 types of alerts that can be configured**

1. Notifications while using the console - this provides visual and sound alerts whenever there are active visitors on your site
2. Email alerts allow you to receive instant and scheduled email alerts for visitor IPs that were tagged using the TraceMyIP console.

= How do I get email notifications and alerts when a specific person visits my website? =

**You can TAG (bookmark) any visitor and set up an email alert**

1. Locate the visitor on your logs that you would like to monitor
2. Click on the Email Alerts icon next to the TAG button
3. Assign the name and select when and how often you would like to get notified via email

For a step-by-step tutorial, see [Visitor Email Alerts](https://www.tracemyip.org/learn/website-visitor-ip-alerts-and-email-notifications-1481/)

= How do I hide the visitor tracker on my pages? =

**To properly hide the tracker icon and make it invisible:**

1. Enable the [Invisible Tracker] option by going to [My Projects] page, clicking on the [edit] link for the project, and selecting the [Invisible Tracker] option. You can also refer to this [Invisible tracker](https://www.tracemyip.org/learn/how-to-make-a-visitor-tracker-invisible-91/) tutorial.
2. Navigate to the WordPress TraceMyIP plugin settings page, and using the "Tracker Icon Position" menu set the option to "Header Script". This may position the tracker on the left of the header or a footer, however, it will become completely invisible once the invisible tracker option is enabled.

*Hiding the tracker with other methods will make tracking data unreliable as browsers tend to not load elements that are hidden otherwise.*

= What information do I get about each website visitor? =

Some key information you'll find on your TraceMyIP reports includes:

* Website visitor IP address, IP address changes
* Visitor GEO location on a city level
* Number of visits and returns over time, full browsing activity history with full URLs of all pages visited and their exact time
* Referring URLs where each visitor found the links to your site 
* Search engine information that brought the visitor to your website
* Visitor Organization, ISP data, hostname, Internet browser information, 
* Visitor Computer specifications include computer ID, screen resolution, operating system, browser type, version, and device name and model. 

Additionally, you have the flexibility to assign custom street addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, and create visitor notes. This custom information will be associated with each person, ensuring easy visitor identification even if their IP address changes.

= Can a specific visitor activity be identified on all of my websites? =

With the IP tracking address book, you can effortlessly scan through all projects to locate the activity of a tagged visitor. Just TAG a visitor and click on the [activity] link to search all website logs for specific computer IP or ID activity.

== What is Zendrop? ==
Looking to instantly sell viral products in your store?
Zendrop is an e-commerce marketplace that connects reliable suppliers with online merchants and dropshipping stores. No more language barriers (with suppliers such as AliExpress), slow shipping times, and mis-branded packaging.

Zendrop offers phenomenal customer support from the US, the fastest shipping times the industry can find, custom branding on all packages, and of course, an English speaking team here to support you 24/7.

Why Zendrop? Glad you asked!

-
== Trusted Suppliers ==
Zendrop was created for Dropshippers, by Dropshippers. We were frustrated having to rely on suppliers from AliExpress to run our business. Communication is slow or non existent, quality is horrible and shipping times? Well…. you guessed it. The worst. Luckily, Zendrop is the solution to the ongoing problems you might find with other dropshipping suppliers! Our Robots make the process easy and streamlined.

Along with having higher quality products and shorter shipping times, Zendrop also has a plethora of trusted suppliers around the world, including US-based suppliers. This means even faster shipping times, all around the world!

-
== Auto-Fulfillment ==
All your future orders will be instantly fulfilled on your store with a click of a button, No more using virtual assistants or manually entering orders yourself. Our Robots at Zendrop complete the entire fulfillment process for you!

All product SKUs will be mapped to your store, so all multi-product orders will be easily fulfilled by Zendrop’s system.

-
== Custom Packaging ==
With Zendrop, you can create custom packaging, Thank You cards, branded inserts and beautiful invoices. While other fulfillment platforms deliver products with international packaging slips and Chinese lettering, Zendrop knows that can damage how the customer feels about their purchase. So we ensure that your customers will feel valued and, as a result, respect your business!

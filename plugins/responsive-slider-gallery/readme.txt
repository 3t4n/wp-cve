This plugin is an effective tool for adding the responsive slider to your website. This plugin can be added both as a widget and plugin, as well as be included in the theme for displaying the slider within the theme using PHP function. Slider WD allows adding images to be displayed as slider slides.

User experience is our #1 priority. That's why we put in extra effort to ensure that Responsive Slider Gallery is the best responsive image slider maker for WordPress. This means that your slider will always look great on all devices (mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop).

This slider builder plugin provides a powerful engine for adding photo or image slides, with the ability to batch upload, import media data, add/delete/rearrange/sort slides and more. You can publish slider at front-end on the blog post, page and in all widget areas available in the theme.

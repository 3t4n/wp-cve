YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search allows your users to search products in real time.

== Description ==
According to several usability studies, **85% of users who access an e-commerce store go straight to the search form.** If they cannot find it and search for the products they want to buy, most of them will abandon the site after a few seconds.

If you already have a search form on your website, but it does not work properly or suggests irrelevant products, the same will happen: **they will abandon your shop and you will lose those sales.**

With the latest version of **YITH WooCommerce AJAX Search**, in just a few minutes, you can set up a modern and usable search form in WooCommerce that’s designed to deliver effective results consistently, search after search.

**The new version of the plugin** is powerful, flexible, and easy to configure. You can place your search form anywhere using the built-in block or shortcode, customize its style and colors, and, most importantly, set a tolerance threshold to find results even if there are some typos in the text.

Go ahead, install the plugin and in just a few clicks you’ll have your customers searching and quickly finding the products they are interested in.

**Features of the free version:**

* Insert the search form using the Gutenberg block

* Insert the search form using the shortcode

* Choose the size of the search form

* Set the placeholder text to show in the form search input

* Set the colors of the form and the “Submit” button

* Enable instant search (autocomplete feature)

* Set the number of characters after which the instant search is triggered

* Search for keywords in product names

* Search for keywords in product (main and short) description

* Show search results in a list layout, one below the other

* Show product names and images

* Configure the maximum number of results to show

* Choose whether to show a "View all results" link

* 100% mobile-friendly layout

*  (NEW!) Statistics panel to analyze the most popular searches, the most-clicked products, and searches with no results.

3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search` from Plugins page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YITH, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days.


= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!

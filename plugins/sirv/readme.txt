Serve perfectly optimized images from the fastest WordPress CDN plugin. Image hosting with deep image zoom, 360 spin, responsive imaging & lazy loading.

== Description ==

Accelerate your website and improve SEO with Sirv – the most complete image CDN and optimization plugin for WordPress.

Automatically resize, compress and serve images in the most [optimal image format](https://sirv.com/blog/optimal-image-format/) over a fast global CDN.

= Why is Sirv the best choice for WordPress image optimization? =

* Automatic image optimization.
* Automatic responsive images (resized to fit users screen).
* Automatic WebP delivery when possible (~30% saving).
* Smaller files than any other WP optimization plugin (~15% saving).
* Incredibly fast WordPress CDN.
* Full WooCommerce support.
* Lazy load your images, to speed up your website even more.
* Protect images with automatic backups.
* Remove image meta for even more optimization.

The best WordPress image optimizer - you don't need to lift a finger. Just install the plugin and Sirv will automatically create and serve the smallest possible file-size (without looking over-compressed). The default settings are perfect for most sites and if you want to get under the hood, every option is very easily adjusted.

= Optimize your WordPress Media Library =

Automatically optimize your existing WordPress media library images, without lifting a finger. Sirv can automatically copy your media library to Sirv, from where images will be served as highly optimized images across Sirv’s fast, global WordPress CDN (19 worldwide locations).

All these images (and more) can be automatically optimized by Sirv:

* Media Gallery images
* Featured images
* WooCommerce images
* Images added via other plugins or scripts
* *NEW* Images added via "Add Media" button

Simply enable the Sirv CDN after you've installed the plugin and Sirv will take care of the rest.

See the [complete list of features](https://sirv.com/features/) of Sirv's fresh new take on image optimization.

== Take your WooCommerce sales to another level ==

* Optimization & CDN delivery for all your product images.
* Add ultra-deep image zoom and 360-spin to product descriptions.
* Add image watermarks to images.
* Add text captions to images.
* Use Sirv for all your websites, apps, eBay & social media.

= Image zoom =

Sirv loves huge images - it can zoom deep inside them very fast. No matter how big, images load fast, just like when you zoom into a Google Map. The bigger your images, the more impressive this image zoom is - perfect if you have really high quality images.

= 360 spin =

Shoppers adore spinning products around to see them from all sides. If you're selling something online, maybe with WooCommerce, Sirv provides a stunning 360-degree photography experience. Simply upload a set of photos and a 360 spin will be immediately ready to embed in your page. It feels incredible on desktop and mobile alike, especially the big full-screen 360 spin view.

Free and paid plans are available, depending on your needs. See "Price Plans" below.

= What our users have to say =

>★★★★★
"We’ve halved the load time on mobiles of a site that we had already done quite a bit of work on to get image sizes down." [@martingfisher](https://wordpress.org/support/users/martingfisher/)

>★★★★★
"So far the best CDN plugin for WordPress. Please, never disappear!" [@mavenickster](https://wordpress.org/support/users/mavenickster/)

>★★★★★
"I was looking for a CDN fast and easy (no need to code)! Sirv is the best – Just upload your photos on your WordPress library and voilà “roulez jeunesse!!!” (French expression). Very good service!" [@disconance](https://wordpress.org/support/users/disconance/)

>★★★★★
"Sirv is fantastic! I have a lot of images on my website, and most of them are large, which resulted in slow site speeds, even with a CDN. What I love about Sirv is that they offer a CDN service, but also dynamically resize images based on the user’s browser/device, and serve the right file type. It has meant HUGE speed improvements on my website." [@basellen](https://wordpress.org/support/users/basellen/)


= Optimal format (every time) =

WebP is probably the best image format you've never heard of. Incredibly, it has the same quality of a JPEG, yet its typically 30% smaller in file-size (versus Sirv's already outstanding JPEG compression).

Sirv is intelligent enough to always serve the smallest possible file format that each of your users' browser supports. For Chrome & Opera, that's usually WebP. Another reason why your pages will instantly load faster, once you install the Sirv plugin for WordPress.

All this is 100% automatic. Add in lazy loading and responsive images and you truly have the best possible image delivery system for WordPress.

= How do I enable WebP image optimization? =

WebP is enabled by default. Sirv automatically optimizes your images in the most suitable format for each users' browser and screen. WebP is usually the smallest file-size for Chrome and Opera, so your images will be served in WebP format (regardless of what image format your original images are). Other browsers will receive either JPEG or PNG, whichever is most optimal.

= Can I serve images from my own domain name? =

You can serve images from any domain or subdomain that you own. All you need is an SSL certificate for that domain/subdomain. You'll update your DNS to point the CNAME to your Sirv account, then all your images will be optimized and served rapidly over HTTPS from Sirv. Follow this [short tutorial](https://sirv.com/help/resources/custom-domain/).

        - For example: fire Webhook whenever a Scheduled Order is Created, or when an item on a Scheduled Order is updated

### How Autoship Processes Repeat Orders: Advanced Automation

The Autoship Cloud plugin's hosted service, QPilot, processes orders using your site's the WooCommerce REST API (link to WC REST API). This enables repeat order processing to take place in the cloud so that your site doesn't get bogged down running tons of code and cron jobs just to process repeat orders. It's also a really nice backup just in case your site has any issues - your repeat orders are still hosted & protected in the cloud!

When a repeat order is due to process, the order shows up in your WooCommerce Orders just like an order that came through the checkout - process, fulfill and track repeat orders just as you normally do.

- Notify customers (n) days before their order processes
- Only a few functions on the checkout page to keep your site load speed fast!
- Set time of day to process repeat orders daily
- Start processing orders in advance of their next occurrence date.  Great for business that need a day or two to fulfill and ship orders.
- Set a custom "changeable before" option for your site to prevent changes to upcoming orders X days before they ship.  Includes a feature to send a custom email notification to let your customers know how much time they have to make changes!
- Orders processed via the [WooCommerce REST API](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/) means that your site can easily scale to process many repeat orders without stressing your WordPress site or hosting!  No more headaches with the WordPress Cron or Action Schedulers dragging your site performance.

![Advanced Automation of WooCommerce Products](https://autoship.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AdvancedAutomationofWooCommerceProducts.png "Advanced Automation of WooCommerce Products")

It's easy to view and track checkout orders that originate Autoship and Product Subscriptions as well as orders created (via the WooCommerce REST API) from processing repeat Scheduled Orders. See an explanation of that in-depth on our documentation: [**How Scheduled Orders are Linked to WooCommerce Orders**](https://support.autoship.cloud/article/463-how-scheduled-orders-are-linked-to-woocommerce-orders).

For detailed and technical information on how Autoship Cloud's hosted service, QPilot, processes orders with WooCommerce, please see our full documentation here: [**How an Autoship Scheduled Order is Processed**](https://support.autoship.cloud/article/535-how-an-autoship-scheduled-order-is-processed).

### Customizable Order Scheduling & Repeat Frequency Options

The individual item price and subtotals will now reflect any discount applied to the Scheduled Order using a "Reduce Product By Amount" or "Reduce Product By Percentage" discount type for coupons assigned to one or more products.

* Improved: Support for the _WooCommerce PayPal Payments_ plugin has been improved by changing when the Autoship Cloud plugin triggers the **'woocommerce_subscription_payment_complete'** action -- which is how the _WooCommerce PayPal Payments_ plugin tokenizes the payment method used during the WooCommerce Checkout.

* Improved: A new option has been added to the Update Product Synchronization bulk utility that can be checked to enable the Add to Scheduled Order and Enable Schedule Options options for all products synchronized with QPilot.

* Improved! Product data synchronization between WooCommerce Products and connected QPilot Sites has been improved by automatically enabling the options for "Add to Scheduled Order" and "Enable Schedule Options" when a product's "Activate Product Sync" setting is enabled in the _WooCommerce > Edit Product_ screen.

* Fixed: starting in version 2.3.2, Scheduled Order data could be inadvertently removed from cart items when the scheduled item was updated in the cart and the option for "Enable to Display Autoship Options" -- located in  _WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud > Settings >> Options ( tab )_  -- for each product in the cart was unchecked.

* New Filters! The following new filters have been added to the plugin:
  * A new **'autoship_exclude_product_coupon_discounts_in_saleprice'** filter has been added to the **autoship_get_calculated_scheduled_order_item_sale_price()** function in the _src/scheduled-orders.php_ file and passes a single boolean parameter which can be used to disable the inclusion of product-level coupon discounts in the displayed product price in the Native UI Display Option ( for displaying Scheduled Orders to customers in _My Account > Scheduled Orders_ )

= 2.3.4 -  2022-08-09

* Improved: the Checkout.com Payment gateway integration has been updated to create Scheduled Orders after completing a checkout using the **'checkout_com_payment_captured'** action which was newly added to the Checkout.com Payment Gateway plugin.

* Improved: the Authorize.net refund metadata assigned to WooCommerce orders generated by QPilot has been updated to now include the charge captured value ('yes') as well as all of the gateway response field names.

* Fixed: Updated to load Autoship Cloud's translated strings when the plugins loaded action fires.  Previously, starting in v1.2.38 a minimum version requirement check was added which inadvertently changed the load order of the plugin files and prevented the translated strings from being loaded.

= 2.3.3 -  2022-07-06

* Fixed: Updated to include the new order-shipping-rate-form.php file for the selectable Shipping Rates support that was added in v2.3.2.

= 2.3.2 -  2022-06-28

- New! Added support for selectable Shipping Rates in the Native UI, Cart, and Checkout. A new option to **Enable Selectable Shipping Rates** can be selected in the WordPress Admin that allows customers to change the assigned Default Shipping Rate for their Scheduled Order when using the **Native UI Display Option** to display Scheduled Orders to Customers in _My Account > Scheduled Orders_ to a Preferred Shipping Rate. This new option is disabled by default and can be enabled in the WordPress Admin ( _WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud > Settings >> Options ( tab )_ ).
  - When a Scheduled Order is viewed by a Customer in the _My Account > Edit Scheduled Order_ screen, and the Scheduled Order has more than one available Shipping Rate option, a new **Edit** link will be displayed next to the Shipping total line. When the link is selected, a new **Preferred Shipping Rate** modal is displayed with a select drop-down menu displaying all of the available Shipping Rates and associated cost as well as the following options:
    - a. **Refresh Rates** - When clicked, the Scheduled Order is re-freshed via the API to see if any new Shipping Rates are available for the Scheduled Order
    - b. **Cancel** - When clicked, no changes are made to the Scheduled Order and the modal is closed
    - c. **Update Shipping Method** - When clicked, the new selected Shipping Rate will be assigned to the Scheduled Order as the Preferred Shipping Rate
  - When a Scheduled Order is viewed by a Customer in the _My Account > Edit Scheduled Order_ screen, and the Scheduled Order has only one available Shipping Rate option, a new **Refresh Rates** link will be displayed next to the Shipping total line. When selected, the Scheduled Order will be refreshed and all of the available Shipping Rates will be re-loaded into the _My Account > Edit Scheduled Order_ screen.
- Improved: the [Checkout.com Payment Gateway](https://wordpress.org/plugins/checkout-com-unified-payments-api/) integration has been updated to support version 4.4.0+ of the Checkuot.com Payment Gateway plugin. Previously, starting in Checkout.com Payment Gateway version 4.4.0 a PHP Fatal error message could occur after checkout and prevent the corresponding Scheduled Order(s) and saved Payment Method from being created successfully in QPilot.
- BETA: Added support for the new [WooCommerce PayPal Payments plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-paypal-payments/). Support for the WooCommerce PayPal Payments plugin is only enabled when a new **(Beta) Experimental Support for WooCommerce PayPal Payments** settings option, found in the new Experimental ( Beta ) Options section in _WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud > Settings >> Options ( tab )_ is checked.  The option is unchecked by default and, when checked, the following functionality is enabled:
  - The **Autoship Cloud Supported Payment Gateways** icon is displayed next to the **PayPal** and **PayPal Card Processing** gateways in the _WooCommerce > Settings > Payments ( Tab )_
  - If 1 or more products scheduled for Autoship are in the cart, and **PayPal** and/or **PayPal Card Processing** are enabled as gateways in the _WooCommerce > Settings > Payments ( Tab )_, then PayPal checkout will be enabled for the cart.
  - When the customer checks out, and 1 or more products scheduled for Autoship are in the cart, and they selected the **PayPal | Credit Card** option, the **Save Your Credit Card** checkbox will be checked by default and can not be unchecked by the customer unless all items scheduled for Autoship are removed from the cart.
  - When the customer places their order and selects either the **PayPal** or **PayPal Card Processing** gateways, the payment method used will be tokenized and saved in the WooCommerce Order Metadata under the value **payment_token_id**
  - The Scheduled Oder data sent to QPilot will include the new **PayPal** or **PayPal Credit Card** token and either a **gatewayPaymentType** set to '25' ( PaypalFundingPaypal ) or '26' ( PaypalFundingCard )
  - Scheduled Orders can be processed by QPilot with these tokenized saved payments, and the resulting WooCommerce Order will include the payment method set to _ppcp-gateway_
  - IMPORTANT NOTE: The WooCommerce PayPal Payments plugin does not support the creation of new saved payment methods by Customers in _My Account > Payment Methods_

= 2.3.1 -  2022-06-21

= 2.3.0 -  2022-05-04

= 2.2.9 -  2022-03-29

- New! **Checkout.com** is now available as a supported payment integration.  Merchants using the *Checkout.com Payment Gateway plugin by Checkout.com* ([https://wordpress.org/plugins/checkout-com-unified-payments-api/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/checkout-com-unified-payments-api/)) can now add this integration for their connected QPilot Site via *WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud > Payment Integrations*.

- Fixed: the Embedded App Display option has been updated to work with the new Date/Time format used by version 2.2.5+

= 2.2.6 - 2022-01-18

- Improved: the display of customer-facing notifications in the Native UI Display Option has been updated to use the customer-friendly version of the failure messages supplied by the QPilot API for lock window and order processing window validation errors.

- Improved: The minimum required version of PHP has been changed from 5.6 to 7.3 in order to help reduce risks of security vulnerabilities possible with older versions of PHP and to support the latest versions of PHP code as recommended by WordPress.

- Fixed: the ability to add a product to the cart with a scheduled frequency using links generated from the Autoship Link Builder. Previously, starting in v2.2.5 products added to the cart using a link generated from the Autoship Link Builder would be added to the cart but only as one-time purchases and not as products scheduled for Autoship.

  - A new 'autoship_customer_user_metrics_refreshed' action is now available in the autoship_refresh_customer_metrics_for_user() function found in the src/customers.php file and can be used to fire custom functions after the customer metrics data for a customer has been updated.

= 2.2.5 - 2021-12-29

- New! This update introduces a change to the Date/Time format that is used for each Scheduled Order’s Next Occurrence Date.  **After updating the plugin, it is very important to run the additional action to update the Date/Time format used for existing Scheduled Orders**. After updating the plugin, admins will see an Important Notice to complete the upgrade process: **"Update to Autoship Scheduled Orders Required!"** When the **Upgrade Processing Version** button is clicked, existing Scheduled Orders will be updated to work with the new compatible Date/Time format.
- New! Scheduled Orders can now include Time in their Next Occurrence Date.  For example: 2022-01-15 13:15:00
- New! A Customer Timezone can now be set for a Scheduled Order! This new setting helps with integrations that want to display the Date for upcoming Scheduled Orders in the timezone that the customer is in.
- New! Merchants can now set a Start Time and End Time for Site Processing to control when Scheduled Orders can be automatically processed.  The Autoship Cloud plugin has been updated so that the integration with QPilot will take into account the Scheduled Order Processing Start and End time ( set within your connected QPilot Site  **_Qpilot > Edit Site > Options ( tab )_** ).  If a Next Occurrence date-time falls outside the site's Processing Start and End Time, it will be automatically adjusted to the Scheduled Order Processing Start time.  The following functionality has been updated to take the Scheduled Order Processing Start and End time into account:
  - How the Relative Next Occurrence date and time is calculated when the “Set Next Occurrence Date Relative to Checkout” feature is set a product in the **_WP-Admin > Edit Product > Autoship ( tab )_**.

This allows developers to customize the **$_POST** variable during the Add to Cart call.
- Improved: The Offset Processing feature that enables you to process Scheduled Orders days in advance of their Next Occurrence Dates has been improved so that Customers will see that their upcoming Scheduled Order's status is “Processing” during the day(s) ahead of their Next Occurrence Date.
- Improved: The Lock Duration feature has been updated to work with the new Date/Time format and also improves the customer experience by showing customers that their Scheduled Order is “Processing” during the time that they are not allowed to make changes. This way your customers see that their Scheduled Order is processing all the way up until their Next Occurrence Date, and are free to make changes only after the Scheduled Order has completed processing.

- New Filters! The following new filters have been added to the plugin:
  - A new **'autoship_site_settings_expiration_duration'** filter has been added to the new autoship_get_remote_site_settings() function found in the _src/admin.php_ file and can be used adjust the expiration duration used for caching the QPilot Site Settings values in the WordPress database.

- Deprecated: the **autoship_get_next_available_date () function**. The **autoship_get_next_available_nextoccurrence() function** found in *src/utilities.php* should be used instead.

* Fixed: a Fatal Error that could occur when a website on a version of WordPress lower than version 5.3, and using *Autoship Cloud powered by QPilot* version 2.0 or higher, receives the REST request for a previously processed Scheduled Order from QPilot. Starting in Autoship Cloud v2.0, the new wp_timezone() WordPress function was used to adjust the date time format for the Next Occurrence value.

* New Functions! The following new functions have been added to the plugin:
  * A new **autoship_product_variations_discount_data()** function has been added to the *src/products.php* file which takes a WC Variable Product or Variable Product ID and retrieves all the Autoship Discount and Options data for that product's variations.

= 2.0.4 =

* Fixed: bug in version 2.0.3 where creating Scheduled Orders after checkout resulted in defaulting the frequency and frequency type to every 1 month. This was caused by the QPilot API Class incorrectly overriding the selected values with the default Months and a frequency of 1.

= 2.0.3 =

* New! The Autoship Cloud Logging system is useful for troubleshooting issues with your Autoship Cloud and QPilot Integration. Entries are added to daily log files and the latest 30 log files are retained.   You can locate this new feature in *WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud > Settings >> Logs (tab)*.

The action allows for the ability to perform various actions before the log entries are added or the directory is created. For example, this would allow merchants to intercept our logging and add it to the WP Debug Log instead of our custom logs.
  * **autoship_after_log_entry** action has been added to the new **autoship_log_entry()** function in *src/logger.php*.

* New! The Autoship Cloud plugin now supports the WooCommerce display format for sale prices on the Product, and Native UI Scheduled Order template pages when the checkout price or recurring price is less than the current price. By default WooCommerce displays the sale format as the non-discounted price with a strikethrough followed by the discounted Autoship Checkout or Recurring Price.
* New! The Next Occurrence date for a Scheduled Order can now be set to the current date. Previously, the Next Occurrence must always be a 1+ days in the future.

* Improved: the consistency of the Next Occurrence localization in the Native UI Scheduled Order template by changing the format of the Next Occurrence value to:
  * Take the current local time into account before converting to the date to Coordinated Universal Time.
  * Only send the date value and not the time portion of the Next Occurrence value
* Improved: the Hosted iFrame and QPilot Merchant Center have been updated to display and save dates using the Merchant Timezone defined in for the QPilot Site instead of the Local Browser's Timezone.
* Improved: Scheduled Orders created at checkout and via the Native UI will now include the origin value for the API.  Scheduled Orders created at checkout will have **CustomerCheckout** set as the origin field value and Scheduled Orders created anywhere else in the Autoship Cloud plugin ( i.e. Native UI, Embedded App, Hosted iFrame, etc ) will have **CustomerApi** set as the origin field value. See #817
* Improved: the Scheduled Order attribution by now including the **"origin"** field in the order data used to create the Scheduled Orders at Checkout and via the Native UI.  If an order is created at checkout the value of the **"origin"** field will be set to **CustomerCheckout**, otherwise the value will be **CustomerApi**.

* Fixed: the Native UI Scheduled Order template so that it correctly displays the "Addt'l Tax & Fees" label in place of the existing "Tax" label when the "Display prices in the shop option" is set to "Including tax" in the WooCommerce > Settings > Tax tab. Previously, starting in version 2.0.1 the label was not updating.

* New!  The Native UI Scheduled Orders and Scheduled Order templates have been updated to support the 'Prices entered with tax option' and the 'Display prices in the shop' option from the *WP-Admin > WooCommerce > Settings >> Tax* tab.
  * When the 'Prices entered with tax' option is set to "No, I will enter prices exclusive of tax" and the 'Display prices in the shop' option is set to "Including tax", the Native UI will adjust the displayed prices for existing scheduled order items, newly added scheduled order items, and the Subtotal and Total to include tax calculated using the **woocommerce wc_get_price_to_display()** function.
  * When the 'Prices entered with tax' option is set to "Yes, I will enter prices inclusive of tax" and the 'Display prices in the shop' option is set to "Excluding tax", the Native UI will adjust the displayed prices for existing scheduled order items, newly added Scheduled Order items, and the Subtotal and Total to exclude tax calculated using the **woocommerce wc_get_price_to_display()** function.
  * When the 'Display prices in the shop option' is set to "Including tax" the "Tax" label in the totals section will change to "Addt'l Tax & Fees" since the prices and totals already include the tax and there may be additional tax ( i.e. shipping tax ) and/or fees added when the Scheduled Order is processed.

* Improved: the Migrations tab (*WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud > Settings >> Migrations*) has been improved to provide a simpler layout of actions with easy to follow help text for each action displayed.

* Improved: the customer shipping information synchronization with QPilot by removing the length restrictions imposed on the following customer shipping api fields: shippingFirstName, shippingLastName, shippingStreet1, shippingStreet2, shippingCity, shippingState, shippingPostcode, shippingCountry, and company.  Previously, these fields might be truncated when the corresponding customer information was sent to QPilot.
* Improved: the customer shipping information synchronization with QPilot by removing the length restrictions imposed on the following customer billing api fields: billingFirstName, billingLastName, billingStreet1, billingStreet2, billingCity, billingState, billingPostcode, billingCountry, phoneNumber, and company.

  * autoship_enable_wc_tax_settings_for_prices_display_default filter has been added to the autoship_enable_wc_tax_seetings_for_prices_display() function in src/scheduled-orders.php. The filter allows the disabling of the WC Tax support in the Native UI.

* Fixed: the Embedded App display option now correctly displays featured WooCommerce Products within the “Featured” tab of the Embedded App.

* Fixed: an issue when trying to delete a connected Site in QPilot.

  * autoship_update_scheduled_orders_on_processing_{action}_gateway action has been added to the autoship_update_scheduled_orders_on_processing() function in src/orders.php.  This action can be used to perform actions when a QPilot generated order is updated to a processing status. The dynamic action portion of the action name is the value from the _payment_method metadata field for the associated order. If that field is empty then "general" will be used. The action includes the Payment Gateway response and the WC_Order object as parameters.

= 1.2.41 =

* New: Autoship Cloud now interprets Coupons applied to Scheduled Orders as Coupons for WooCommerce Orders.  Previously, Coupons on Scheduled Orders could only be included as Fee Line items on orders created in WooCommerce and this would sometimes result in inaccurate tax rate calculations.
  * The new functionality checks for the existence of Coupon Fee Lines in Orders created in WooCommerce by QPilot via the WC REST API and does the following:
    * Removes the Coupon Fee Lines and stores them into a _qpilot_legacy_fee_lines metadata field on the WooCommerce Order so that the Coupon Fee Lines can always be re-applied programmatically if needed as well as for auditing purposes.
    * Each Coupon Fee Line is converted to a “virtual” coupon via the new autoship_generate_virtual_wc_coupon() function. See the WooCommerce documentation for the virtual flag here. These virtual coupons are also stored with the Order in a new _qpilot_dynamic_coupons metadata field so that they can be applied in the future.
    * After the order is created in WooCommerce, the virtual coupons are re-applied one by one, letting WooCommerce calculate taxes, re-calculate totals, and deal with rounding natively on the line item level.
* New: Added a new Option within WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud > Settings to “Display QPilot Coupons as Fee Lines” in case a merchant prefers to limit Coupons included on Scheduled Orders to Fee Line items instead of using the new Coupon Fee Lines functionality.
* New: Added a new Option for WooCommerce Products activated for Autoship to override the default Next Occurrence behavior and choose to “Set Next Occurrence Date Relative to Checkout”.  This enables merchants to choose a number of Days, Weeks or Months after Checkout for when the Scheduled Order created for this product should be scheduled for (also known as the “next occurrence date”).

* Fixed: Removed old functions within Checkout.php that would cause some sites to send an incorrect Stock Status for products that allow backorders.

* New Filters! The following New Filters have been added:
  * autoship_qpilot_orders_via_rest filter has been added to the autoship_qpilot_orders_update() callback function for the Autoship Orders endpoint in src\api.php. This filter can be used to adjust the rest request data coming in through the endpoint prior to the call to WC_REST_Orders_Controller::create_item().
  * autoship_qpilot_orders_via_rest_enable_fee_lines filter has been added to the autoship_qpilot_orders_update_via_rest_convert_fees_to_coupons() function in src\coupons.php. This filter can be used to disable the virtual coupons functionality and re-enable the legacy fee line method for QPilot orders coming in on the Rest API.
  * autoship_qpilot_orders_update_via_rest_apply_coupons filter has been added to the autoship_qpilot_orders_update_via_rest_apply_coupons() function in src\coupons.php. This filter can be used to disable / enable the virtual coupons functionality by order for orders coming in on the Rest API.
  * autoship_rest_generated_virtual_wc_coupons filter has been added to the autoship_qpilot_orders_update_via_rest_convert_fees_to_coupons() function in src\coupons.php. This filter can be used to adjust the virtual coupons generated from the fee lines on the rest order.
  * autoship_generated_virtual_wc_coupon filter has been added to the autoship_generate_virtual_wc_coupon() function in src\coupons.php. This filter can be used to adjust a virtual coupon as it's generated and perform other tasks related to that coupon.
  * autoship_coupon_types_by_code filter has been added to the autoship_get_coupon_type_by_code() function in src\coupons.php. This filter can be used to adjust how QPilot Coupon Types are converted to WC Coupon types.

= 1.2.40 =

* Fixed: Issue where a Notice was being displayed incorrectly due to a reference to a legacy $error variable that was removed when the product metadata summary was refactored.
* Fixed: Issue when updating WooCommerce Products that allow backorders was sending an Out of Stock status for the product or variation to QPilot.  Products and variations that allow backorders now consistently send an InStock stock status to QPilot.
* Fixed: Issue where Stock QTY was sending an AbsInt value for the stock level which means that the stock level was always sent as a positive number.  This has been corrected so that Out of Stock and backordered products can send a negative number value for stock level.
* Fixed: Issue with Autoship Sync was not updating the product type correctly or including the parent ID for product variations.  The automatic sync process has been updated to so that product type synchronizes consistently and includes the parent ID for product variations.

* New Actions! The following New Actions have been added:
  * autoship_after_print_product_custom_fields action has been added to the autoship_print_product_custom_fields() function in src/product-page.php to allow developers to extend the Autoship Options on the Edit Product screen.
  * autoship_after_print_variable_product_custom_fields_group action has been added to the autoship_print_variable_product_custom_fields() function in src/product-page.php to allow developers to extend the Autoship Options on the Edit Product > Variations tab.
  * autoship_after_print_variable_product_custom_fields action has been added to the autoship_print_variable_product_custom_fields() function in src/product-page.php to allow developers to extend the Autoship Options on the Edit Product > Variations tab.

* Improved Filters: The following Filters have been improved:
  * autoship_total_product_summary_data action has been improved in the autoship_get_product_sync_summary() function in src/products.php to include a new summaries parameter that allows developers to use the QPilot API response in functions filtering the summary data.
  * autoship_total_variation_product_summary_data action has been improved in the autoship_get_product_sync_summary() function in src/products.php to include a new summaries parameter that allows developers to use the QPilot API response in functions filtering the summary data.

= 1.2.39 =

* Improved: Updated the API Health Check notification within WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud > Settings to show "UnHealthy" if any API tests return an unexpected error. This ensures that site owners are aware of errors that their site returns when an API request is made.
* Improved: Scheduled Order Attribution data has been expanded to track how many Scheduled Orders are expected to be created from an Autoship Checkout versus how many are actually linked to the WooCommerce Order.

* Fixed: The Autoship discount string has been updated so that it shows the recurring price instead of a "0" when a recurring price is entered and no checkout discount price.

= 1.2.38 =

* New! Scheduled Order Attribution has been added to WooCommerce Order data.  This enalbes merchants to quickly see when a WooCommerce Order contains products that are selected for Autoship as well as review which Scheduled Order(s) were created as a result.  We've also added notifications that will warn merchants if a Scheduled Order was expected to be created but does not appear to be associated with the WooCommerce Order.  In addition the following two functions have been added specifically to find the source of a WC Order generated by QPilot
  * autoship_get_scheduled_order_wc_source_id() function which takes the QPilot order ID and returns the ID for the original WC Order from which the Scheduled order was created.
  * autoship_get_wc_order_source_id() function which takes a WC Order ID or WC_Order object for an order generated by QPilot and returns the ID for the original WC Order from which the Scheduled order was created.

* Improved: An alert for "WooCommerce Required" will display in the WP-Admin when the WooCommerce plugin is not active.
* Improved: Orders.php has been organized to the same standard as product.php and product-page.php so that developers can more easily find, use, and understand the plugin functions.
* Improved: Scheduled Order display options and active autoship cloud extensions now synchronize their settings with other site metadata in QPilot in order to better track usage of customizations and extension usage.

* Fixed: The "!" warning badge displayed in the WP-Admin Menu (WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud) was not clearing after issues were resolved.  The badge now clears and displays as expected.

* Improved: A warning indicator will now be displayed on the Autoship Cloud menu and Autoship Cloud Products Submenu options when one or more Invalid products exist in QPilot.

* Fixed: PayPal (Express) Checkout now does not require customers to create PayPal Billing Agreements for one-time purchases during WooCommerce checkout.  Previously, the Autoship Cloud plugin was enforcing the Billing Agreement workflow regardless if any products were selected or Autoship.

= 1.2.36 =

* Improved: Units of measurement for WooCommerce Products can now be synchronized with QPilot when the unit of measurement is unique to a specific WooCommerce Product or Variation. The following filters are now available to adjust the unit of measurement for weight and dimensions on a product by product basis: the ‘autoship_get_mapped_product_weight_unit' filter can be used to supply QPilot with the weight unit of measurement for a product and the ‘autoship_get_mapped_product_length_unit’ filter can be used to supply QPilot with the dimension unit of measurement for a product.

* Improved: A warning modal will now be displayed when a user clicks on the "Edit" link to change the Status of a Product or the visibility of a product and that product is currently being synchronized with QPilot.

= 1.2.34 =

* Fixed: Resolved issue in version 1.2.32 where the Next Occurrence date was not being assigned to Scheduled Orders correctly and prevented Scheduled Orders from being created at checkout.

= 1.2.33 =

* Fixed: The "Update WooCommerce Product Synchronization" bulk action will now correctly Activate any products with Autoship options enabled.

= 1.2.32 =

* New! Product data synchronization features have been added to ensure that merchants can select which WooCommerce Products should be continuously synchronized with QPilot. Users who are updating the plugin will be prompted to run a bulk update action to ensure that only products that currently have Autoship options enabled continue to synchronize with QPilot. Running this update will help to ensure that your site can synchronize product data quickly and helps to improve general performance with data and reporting.
* New! Autoship Cloud now displays alerts & notifications within the WordPress Admin to inform administrators about the status of Autoship Cloud Product Data.
* New! [Customer Email Notifications](https://support.autoship.cloud/article/438-email-notifications) for specific Scheduled Order Errors have been added to QPilot Sites. These email notifications can be optionally enabled to notify customers to respond to a failed Scheduled Order.

* Improved: Scheduled Order Lock Notification email templates can now receive basic customizations like other customer email notification templates.
* Improved: The Autoship Cloud Products report (WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud > Products) now only displays Active products by default.

* Fixed: Updated to include the order-address-form template file for the new Edit Shipping Address feature.

= 1.2.30 =

* New! Customers can now edit the shipping address of a Scheduled Order directly using the Native UI display option in My Account > Scheduled Orders.  This enables a customer to have Scheduled Orders addressed and delivered to different locations.  Previously, this was only possible using the Embedded App display option or by updating the Shipping Address in My Account > Addresses to apply the change to all Scheduled Orders instead of one.

* Added:  Error Codes have been added for Scheduled Order Processing.  This makes it easy for merchants to respond to issues that can cause Scheduled Orders to fail.   The Error Codes are displayed with the Processing Result on the WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud > Dashboard, as well as the History Event Logs and Processing Cycles that are viewable in WP-Admin > Autoship Cloud > Scheduled Orders.

* Fixed: The Edit Payment Method Form displayed in the Native UI will now be correctly displayed when the Edit Payment Method button is selected within the Scheduled Orders screen.  Previously, starting in version 1.2.25, the Edit Payment Form was hidden for any Scheduled Orders with one or more scheduled items.
* Fixed: The Trust Commerce payment gateway integration will now save the payment token in the Gateway Customer ID field and set the Gateway Payment ID field to NULL on Scheduled Orders created at checkout.  Previously, the two values were flipped causing an error during payment processing.

= 1.2.26 =

* New! A custom endpoint has been added that helps prevent order duplication and interference arising from other plugins hooked into the WooCommerce Orders REST API. QPilot will now check for an existing WooCommerce Order using the new endpoint prior to hitting the WC_REST_Orders_Controller - previously, QPilot would hit the Create Order endpoint and then check for duplicate orders.

* Fixed: Issue with the Native UI display where viewing a single Scheduled Order in My Account > Scheduled Orders would also display additional templates

= 1.2.25 =

We’ve been [active on GitHub](https://github.com/olark?utm_campaign=wordpress-listing&utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=directory) since 2011, and **strongly believe in supporting the open source movement**.

Our [JavaScript API](https://www.olark.com/api/?utm_campaign=wordpress-listing&utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=directory) gives you flexibility and control over the Olark chatbox. Together with Webhooks and Zapier, you can [add your own custom integrations](https://www.olark.com/integrations?utm_campaign=wordpress-listing&utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=directory) (in addition to many pre-built ones)!

>
> “Since we started using Olark, there's definitely a more manageable flow of inquiries. We have more time available to spend on the phone with complex/larger inquiries and a reduction in people phoning to ask something simple like the delivery charge or stock levels. We can put more time into closing an order for, say, £2500, rather than stuck on the phone with a few people making £50 orders."

The Joy of Text (or JOT) plugin provides a great way of connecting with your customers, blog subscribers or club members. This plugin allows you to send both SMS and text-to-voice messages to a group or to individuals.

To use this plugin you will need:

* A [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com "Twilio") account. If you don't have a Twilio account, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) account.
* A Twilio phone number - either one you've purchased or your [Twilio free trial](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223136107-How-does-Twilio-s-Free-Trial-work-) number.
* Your unique 'Twilio Account SID' and 'Twilio Auth Token' - you'll enter these details into the Joy Of Text plugin's settings. 

This free version includes the following features:

* Allows SMS and text-to-voice messages to be sent a group or individuals.
* Creates a default group, into which subscriber names and phone numbers can be added.
* Allows administrators to add, delete and update members from the group.
* Creates a subscription form, allowing website visitors to subscribe to SMS updates.
* Provides merge tags that can be included into the message, allowing the subscriber's name, number or a link to your last blog post to be substituted into the message.
* Provides the option to automatically send an SMS message to new subscribers. You can specify the content of this welcome message, which can include website and media links.
* Checks that each phone number entered is valid.
* Has support for a number of extensions.


The extensions available for the UWS Pro plugin are:

* Woocommerce Subscription extension - This [extension](https://ultimatewpsms.com/uws-woocommerce-subscription-integration/) - will send out new subscription notifications and will let you sync Woo customers into UWS, allowing you to send SMS messages to your valued customer base.
* Message Scheduling extension - The [Scheduler extension](https://ultimatewpsms.com/uws-scheduler-extension/) allows you to schedule messages to be sent at a future date and time.
* Post and comment Notifier - The [Notifier](https://ultimatewpsms.com/uws-post-and-comment-sms-notifier/) will send SMS notifications to your customers, when a new post is added or updated.

As discussed in this [article](http://www.mobilemarketingwatch.com/sms-marketing-wallops-email-with-98-open-rate-and-only-1-spam-43866/), SMS messages have "open rate" of 98%, i.e. 98% of all SMS messages sent, are opened by the recipient. This compares to only 22% of emails sent, so give your marketing a boost, by sending SMS messages from the JOT plugin.


**The JOT Lite Admin screens explained.**

The "Settings" tab

Within this tab your [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com "Twilio") authentication details are entered. Once you have entered your Twilio details, you can select the 'from' number from which your messages will be sent.

You can also use this screen to choose your voice and language preference, which is used when sending text-to-voice messages.

The "Message" tab

Use this tab to construct your messages. First select the recipients of your message, then enter your message. The message can contain the special tags shown below:

* %name% - when the message is sent, this tag is replaced by the message recipients name.
* %number% - the tag is replaced by the recipients phone number.
* %lastpost% - the tag is replaced by the URL of your last blog post.

From this tab, you can also specify a message suffix, that will be appended to all messages.

You can also specify whether your message is sent as an SMS message or as a text-to-voice message. For text-to-voice messages, the text you enter will be converted (by Twilio) to speech, which is played to your chosen recipients when they answer their phones.

The "Group Manager" tab

The free version of the plugin provides one member group. 

From this tab you can change the name and description of the group. You can add new members to the group, delete existing members from the group or update their name and number details.

From the "Group Invite" you can construct a form which you can place on your website, to invite your website visitors to subscribe to SMS or text-to-voice message updates. You can also choose whether to send a new subscriber an SMS message containing a welcome message. The HTML for your form is provided on this tab or you can choose to use the shortcode `[jotform]`.

The [Pro version](https://ultimatewpsms.com/ultimate-wp-sms/) allows an unlimited number of member groups to be created.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the associated costs ? =

This plugin is free, however to use it, you need a Twilio account and number. Twilio will charge you a monthly fee for a phone number and they'll charge you for each message you send. The Twilio charges vary, depending on which country you are in.

Please refer to [Twilio's charges](https://www.twilio.com/sms/pricing) for more detail.


= Are other SMS providers supported? =

No, only the excellent Twilio service is supported.

= Do new subscribers need to enter both their name and number? =

By default the plugin expects new subscribers, to enter both their name and number into the form created either using the [jotform] shortcode or using the HTML supplied on the
"Group Invite" tab.

However, if you only want new subscribers to enter their phone number, you can alter you form as shown below, with a hidden name field or use the shortcode
[jotform id=1 name=no]

`<div>
  <form id="jot-subscriber-form-1" action="" method="post">
      <input type="hidden"  name="jot-group-id" value="1">
      <input type="hidden"  name="jot_form_id" value="jot-subscriber-form">
      <input type="hidden"  name="jot-form-special"  id="jot-form-special" class="jot-special" value="">
      <input type="hidden"  name="jot-verified-number"  id="jot-verified-number"  value="">
      <input id="jot-subscribe-name" name="jot-subscribe-name" type="hidden" value="No name given"/>
      <fieldset class="jot-fieldset">
          <h3 id="jot-confirm-header">Get SMS updates!</h3>
          <p>
          <label for="jot-subscribe-num">Enter your number:</label>
          <input id="jot-subscribe-num" name="jot-subscribe-num" maxlength="200" size="40" type="text"/>
          <p>
          <input type="button" id="jot-subscribegroup-button" class="button" value="Subscribe"/>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset class="jot-fieldset">
          <div id="jot-subscribemessage"></div>
       </fieldset>
  </form>
</div>`

= Can SMS messages be received by the plugin? =

Not with this free version. The [pro version](http://www.getcloudsms.com/) does allow inbound SMS messages to be accepted and forwarded onto another cell phone number. The pro version is available [here](http://www.getcloudsms.com).

= Will this plugin help me advertize my business? =

A number of users have used the plugin to distribute links to their website, app store listing or digital media. The JOT plugin allows forms to be placed on your website, inviting visitors to subscribe to SMS updates. When visitors enter their number successfully, the JOT plugin can be configured to send a "welcome message" in an SMS. 

Using this feature, you can use the "welcome message" to send new subscribers a link or links to your site or media via SMS messages.


= What hooks are available? =

The following hook is triggered, after someone subscribes using the subscription form, [jotform] -

<pre><code>do_action('jot_after_subscriber_added',$subscriber_args)</code></pre>

where $subscriber_args, is an array containing the member's ID, name and phone number.

The following hooks triggered, after a new member has been added to the group, using the JOT admin screens -

<pre><code>do_action('jot_after_member_added',$subscriber_args)</code></pre>

where $subscriber_args, is an array containing the member's ID, name and phone number.

The following hooks triggered, after a member has been removed from the group, using the JOT admin screens -

<pre><code>do_action('jot_after_member_deletion_from_group',$member, $group)</code></pre>

where $member is an array containing details of the member and $group is the group id, which will be set to 1.

= Can I change JOTFORM's colors? =
To change the colors of the labels and fields of the JOTFORM shortcode, take a look at the custom CSS rules [here](https://www.getcloudsms.com/changing-the-colors-of-the-jotform-shortcode/)

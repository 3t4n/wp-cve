Adds LocaliQ's tracking code on all pages.

== Description ==

The LocaliQ WordPress plugin adds the tracking code to the WordPress site.  This plugin adds the required javascript code on all pages in order to track analytics and enable other features for the [LocaliQ](https://localiq.com) products and other digital marketing solutions.

The required javascript is loaded from a CDN at cdn.rlets.com/capture_static/mms/mms.js. This file is under continuing development to provide the best performance and stability across all browser and OS combinations.

As new features and functionality are added to LocaliQ Tracking, those updates will be rolled out through the mms.js file, and no updates of this plugin will be required.  

For more information on [LocaliQ](https://localiq.com) visit:

== Installation ==

2. In the WordPress dashboard, navigate to the 'Settings' menu.
3. Select the 'LOCALiQ Tracking Code' option from the menu.

== API Interaction provided by capture_configs js from the CDN ==

1. The capture_configs js loads the customerâ€™s configuration data from LocaliQ
2. Sends analytics data back to LocaliQ for performance metrics.
3. Sends visit & referrer attribution back to LocaliQ for analytics
4. Sends visit, email, and form post data back to LocaliQ to provide lead management.
5. Email links are replaced with contact forms and the form data and sending of email is offloaded to LocaliQ's servers.

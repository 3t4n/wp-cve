Let customers choose the date and time they would like their delivery or pickup order to take place using a datetime picker on the WooCommerce checkout page.

== Description ==

[Chwazi](https://chwazidatetime.com) (pronounced Shway-zee) is a Delivery & Pickup Scheduling Date Time Picker Plugin for WooCommerce that allows store owners to add date and time fields (date calendar and timepicker) to the checkout page so customers can choose their desired date and time for receiving an order. It's a full-featured order scheduling plugin for WooCommerce which allows you to fine-tune the customer's checkout process.

Customers can choose between creating a Delivery order where you deliver to them, or a Pickup order where they pickup. The plugin allows for powerful scheduling features that lets you set what days and times you offer delivery/pickup services.

## NOTE

The plugin does not currently support the WooCommerce Blocks checkout. To use this plugin you need to have a normal checkout page that has the `[woocommerce_checkout]` shortcode. If you're setting up a brand new website with a fresh version of WooCommerce installed on it, then by default, WooCommerce will create your checkout page as a Blocks checkout page. 

For this plugin to work, you need to **delete all contents of that blocks page** and add the shortcode: `[woocommerce_checkout]` inside it. You can see this link for reverting to classic checkout: [WooCommerce article](https://woo.com/document/cart-checkout-blocks-status/#section-6) 

Once thats done you'll have the normal WooCommerce checkout page and the plugin options will show. Still need help? Submit a support request [here](https://chwazidatetime.com/contact).

## How Can Chwazi - Delivery & Pickup Scheduling for WooCommerce Help Me?

This plugin is great for stores that need to know what date and/or time is best to deliver customer orders since customers have the ability to set the date and/or time that is best for them.

The plugin can work for stores that just accept customer pickups, or stores that only do delivery, or stores that do both!

The plugin is not limited to stores that sell food or physical items. It can also be used on service websites such as Taxi websites, or Service Provider websites-- so that customers can choose a date and time they'd like to be picked up (in the case of a taxi website) or the date and time the plumber should come (in the case of a service provider website)

## WooCommerce Checkout Calendar Plugin

Chwazi - Delivery & Pickup Scheduling plugin adds a full checkout calendar to your WooCommerce store. With this calendar customers can choose their desired dates for delivery or pickup of orders. The days of the week available to customers are based on what you set in the plugin's settings.

## WooCommerce Date Time Picker Plugin

It's also possible to allow customers to select the time they'd like the order to be received or picked up. Store owners can create different time slots for various days of the week that customers can select, or they can leave a day without time slots so customers can choose any time they wish.

## WooCommerce Order Reminder Plugin

With the Reminders feature, you can automatically notify customers about their upcoming delivery/pickup orders. This adds an extra bit of professionalism to your WooCommerce store; always keeping customers up to date on their order.

## WooCommerce Schedule Orders in Google Calendar Plugin

Seamlessly integrate with Google Calendar to eliminate manual entry and streamlining order management. The Google Calendar Add-On allows you to Schedule WooCommerce orders inside Google Calendar. With the Custom Event Builder feature, you can tailor events with dynamic order details using intuitive Magic Tags. Stay organized by tracking deliveries, pickups, and order specifics in one centralized hub (Google Calendar). Elevate your workflow efficiency and minimize errors with Chwazi's Google Calendar Add-On for WooCommerce.

## Chwazi - Delivery & Pickup Scheduling Features

**Display Options** - Select where on the checkout page you'd like the date and time picker to show.

**Locale Settings** - Set your timezone, preferred date and time format as well as which day the week starts on. It's also possible to change different text shown by the plugin on the front end of the website.

**Email Display Settings** - Set in which emails the order fulfillment date and time selected by the customer appears as well as the position in the email.

**Default order type** - Set the default order type offered by your store, whether Delivery or Pickup.

**Order type offered by store** - The plugin is a full-featured delivery plugin for WooCommerce, you can choose to only offer delivery on your store or allow pickups as well. These terms are subjective since some websites can consider a "pickup" as a "delivery"!

**Operating Days** - Set the days when you offer delivery or pickup on your WooCommerce store. It's also possible to set the number of days in advance a customer can place a delivery/pickup order to give you maximum flexibility.

**Operating Times** - Set the times for individual days that you plan to offer delivery/pickup services. They can work independently!

**Timeslot Fees** - Want to charge extra if a customer places a late order? Set custom fees for your created timeslots quick and easily. 

**Reminders** - Automatically send emails to customers notifying and reminding them about their upcoming order.

**Customer Note** - Show a message to the customer below the date and time picker fields. This can be used to show your store address in the case of pickup orders.

**Localization Settings** - You have the ability to change different text shown on the frontend of the website. Don't want to use the word "Delivery"? No problem, change it to "We Deliver" if you like! It's also possible to change the calendar language and use your own native text for days and months.

**Locations** - Create delivery or pickup locations that customers can select to receive their orders.

### Below are a few types of stores that would benefit tremendously from this plugin: 

- Online Food Delivery websites
- Online Supermarkets
- Online Furniture websites
- Restaurants offering delivery via their website
- Hardware Rental & Delivery websites
- Car Rental websites
- Pickup service websites
- Taxi and pickup scheduling websites
- And more

### How it works

Once enabled from the General settings, the plugin works by adding a Switcher on the checkout page that lets customers switch between "Delivery" and "Pickup"

It also adds a datepicker and a timepicker field. The customer selects their desired date from the calendar that shows when the date picker field is clicked and can also select their desired time from the time picker field.

Its possible to make both of these fields required as well disabling either one of them.

When a customer switches an order to "Delivery", all "local pickup" shipping methods are removed. When they select "Pickup" ONLY "local pickup" shipping methods are returned.

Creates a page in the admin panel under Settings > List All URLs that outputs an ordered list of all of the website's published URLs.

== Description ==

This plugin will add a page to the admin panel that displays a numerically ordered list of all published URLs within a website.

Now, why would such a feature be helpful?

First off, it allows to to quickly check all of your website URLs to ensure they are using valid characters (i.e no % symbols that may have been entered by copying and pasting from another document).

Secondly, let's say you're planning on moving your website to a new URL, or perhaps you would like to update many of your website's existing URLs for better SEO or accessibility. This plugin give you a quick and easy way to view all website URLs on one single screen and can serve as a great starting point for creating a list of 301 redirects as part of an .htaccess file.

NEW FOR VERSION .2

Now you can customize your list of URLs by page, post, custom post type, or simply get all URLs like in the original version.

There is also a new option which can turn the list of generated URLs into clickable hyperlinks.

If you spot a bug or have an idea of how I can improve my code please let me know.

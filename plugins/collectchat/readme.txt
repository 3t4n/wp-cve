Actively being used on **15,000+ websites** including Airbnb, Techstars, Saudi and UK governments, Bank of Bhutan.

Our bot widgets are being used on all web platforms like WordPress including Wix, Squarespace, Shopify, Woocomerce. It’s also compatible with page builders like Elementor, Divi, Beaver, WP Bakery, Gutenberg Blocks, Visual Composer, Themify etc. It’s useful as a contact bot, a feedback bot, a survey bot, an FAQ bot and more. You are in total control of the conversational bot.

**USE-CASES OF CHATBOT**

* **Lead Generation via chat inside websites.** There is no better way to interact with visitors and grab their contact information, than an interactive chatbot. The human-friendly bot is capable of changing the conversation flow depending on user interaction. It gets you the data to drive email campaigns and marketing programs.
* **Appointment booking using the chatbot.** Don’t go back and forth emails between a customer to find the right time to book a call. Do it on the spot. Our appointment booking shows the times that you are available in their timezone. All they have to do is pick a time and you will get the event saved on Google Calendar.
* **Automating data collection with chatbot integrations.** With too many information coming in, it’s vital to organise and work on each inquiry, one at a time. This where the integrations play a part. On top of getting email notifications, you can send the data to Google Sheets, or a CRM of your choice like Hubspot or even create a support ticket in, let’s say FreshDesk.
* **Substitute a dedicated livechat team and save money.** Having a livechat team available 24x7 would be awesome. But many small businesses can’t do that. This is why we recommend using a chatbot on the website. The first touch point is from the chatbot and then based on the lead qualification system, you can decide whether or not guide the user to a live chat system or not. This approach has saved a lot of time and $$$ for our end customers.
* **Survey and Feedback collection.** There is no nice way to do a survey or ask for feedback. It’s one of the hardest tasks to get people to fill them in. However, our customers have had more success with our interactive chatbots. The completion rate on our chatbot tool is higher than most of our competitors.


We provide full customer support to help you achieve your goals. Here’s what our customer’s had to say:

Yes, anybody can make a chatbot and get started right away. We have a Free forever plan. No credit card required. Adding a chat interface will boost the engagement on your site. Those who have more visitors or seeking advanced features can always upgrade to a paid plan.


= Are there any hidden fees? = 
Nope. You only have to opt for a paid plan, if you have high traffic or need access to our advanced features.

= What is Collect.chat, in brief? =
Using Collect.chat, you can setup a chatbot on your website; in a matter of minutes; without having to code a single line. Our chatbot will take your visitor experience to the next level and collects data in an interactive way.

= How much coding is involved? =
Zero! All you have to do is simply drag and drop from our collection of tried and tested message types to make the conversation for the chatbot.

= Will the chatbot slow down my site? =
Nope. Collect.chat will handle the heavy work for you. The chatbot runs on worldclass AWS S3 CDN and Microsoft Azure Cloud. You don’t have to worry about a thing.

= Can I rely on the chatbot? =
Reliability is our top priority! Once the chatbot is deployed, it will be available 24x7 to greet your visitors and collect their information. Every response is recorded.

= Is Collect.chat a Messenger Chatbot plugin? =
Our chatbot interacts with customers inside your website, without taking them to the messenger platform. Many users are reluctant to communicate from their Facebook profile because of privacy reasons. We do have the feature to redirect the user to your messenger after the conversation is complete.

= Can I chat with customers in real-time? =
Collect.chat is not a live chat widget. It works automatically on pre-designed conversations that the bot maker has designed. You get instant email messages about the conversation and can get in touch after qualifying them. However, you can add links of Messenger, Tawk.to, Whatsapp to help the user if necessary. It’s time to replace tools like Zopim, Chatra, Livechatinc, Formilla, Jivo chat, Crisp, WP Live chat and see better results with chatbots.

= Why should I use a chatbot and not a contact form? =
Contact forms are static by nature. Adding a form to a chatbot on a site is similar to how you would put a donation box in a sales store and just hopes that people will donate. Unfortunately that doesn’t happen. You need to be proactive and that’s exactly what chatbots can do. They capture the attention of the user in a gentle manner and gets to know them. Then slowly the bot is able to progress the conversation and get all the details you need and still end up delivering a great user experience. Plugins like Contact Form 7, Ninja Forms, WPForms, Fluent forms, Everest Forms can help you set up contact forms. But only Collect.chat can help you make interactive bots for your website.

= Why should I stop using pop-up forms? =
Pop up forms interfere with the browsing experience. That’s what they are designed to do. No matter which plugin you use; OptinMonster, Popup Builder, Poptin, WP Popups, the result is the same. You are delivering a poor customer experience that might annoy the user to the end, that they might not come back or recommend your service to others. This where Collect.chat is different. Our bots do not disturb the user. They only open when the user clicks on the avatar (unless you have set a trigger). 

= Why is embedding a chatbot better than creating a squeeze page? =
Squeeze pages and splash pages have the same issues as a contact form. They are not proactive. Chatbots are interactive and more fun to use. Our bots can be easily embedded on a wordpress post or page. Here are the instructions for embedding the bot.

= How can I get more help with the Collect.chat? =
Please go to help.collect.chat and see if your questions are already answered. We also have a community of chatbot makers that you should check out. If you are still unable to get your answers, please mail to care@collect.chat

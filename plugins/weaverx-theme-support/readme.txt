A useful shortcode and widget collection for Weaver Xtreme

== Description ==

This is the theme support for the Weaver Xtreme Theme. This plugin provides a collection of useful shortcodes and widgets designed to complement the Weaver Xtreme theme. These shortcodes have been selected and developed based on requests and feedback from thousands of users of the Weaver Xtreme and previous versions of Weaver.

This plugin also provides the Legacy Weaver Xtreme Admin Dashboard interface. The Legacy Admin is an old style interface alternative to the Customizer interface. The Legacy Interface has been updated for compatibility with Weaver Xtreme Version 5, and will automatically update and convert .wxt settings files from Weaver Xtreme 4.

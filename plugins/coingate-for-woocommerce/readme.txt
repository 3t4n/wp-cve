= Functionality =

* Manage payout options for each accepted cryptocurrency.

= How it works - example =

1. An item in the store costs 100 euro.
2. A customer wants to buy the item and selects to pay with Bitcoin.
3. An invoice is generated and, according to the current exchange rate, the price is 50,000 euro per bitcoin, so the customer has to pay 0.002 bitcoins.
4. Once the invoice is paid, the merchant gets a notification and is credited 99 euro (100 euro minus our 1% flat fee), or 0.00198 BTC.

To be able to use the plugin you have to create an account on [https://coingate.com/accept](https://coingate.com/accept)

== Installation ==

First and foremost, you will need to sign up for an account on CoinGate. For production, use our main website: [https://coingate.com/](https://coingate.com). But before you go live, you may want to do some testing, to make sure everything works nicely. For this purpose, we have a sandbox environment: [https://sandbox.coingate.com](https://sandbox.coingate.com/) – just remember to create an account here even if you already have one on our main website.

The installation of our WooCommerce payment module is quite easy. In order to ensure that CoinGate payment gateway is working properly on your website, we will go over these two quick steps:

* Setup API credentials on CoinGate.
* Install the CoinGate payment module for WooCommerce.

For the testing mode to work, you must generate separate API credentials on [https://sandbox.coingate.com](https://sandbox.coingate.com), since API credentials generated on [https://coingate.com](https://coingate.com) will not work in the sandbox environment. To create a set of API credentials, log in to your CoinGate account, and either complete the auto-setup wizard, or find the API tab on the menu – click “Apps”, and then click “+New App”.

*Please note, this guide was created using WordPress 4.7.4, but is also useful for installing older or upcoming versions.*

1. Login to your WordPress admin panel and go to Plugins > Add New.
2. In the Search Plugins field, type in “coingate”. When the CoinGate for WooCommerce plugin is displayed, click “Install Now” (if asked, enter your FTP credentials).
3. After the plugin is installed, click “Activate”.
4. Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > Method : “CoinGate – Cryptocurrencies via CoinGate (more than 50 supported)” and then click the check box “Enabled”. After Enabled is clicked then press on CoinGate on the same page. If needed, change the Description and the Title according to your preferences.
5. Enter your API credentials on the WooCommerce configuration page.
6. Set the *Receive Currency* parameter to the currency in which you wish to receive your payouts from CoinGate.
At this point, you can also configure how CoinGate order statuses will correspond to WooCommerce order statuses. Leave the default options if you are not sure.
7. If you are using Sandbox API credentials, then turn Test Mode on.
8. Finally, click “Save changes”, and you are good to go!

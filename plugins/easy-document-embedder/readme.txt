Document embedding on a website is a common thing we need to do regularly. By using this plugin you can embed all the common files like PDF, Word, XLS, PPT, and many more. This saves your time and makes your manual document embedding process easy. We have added a single click option so that you can embed your desired file in just one click via this plugin.

<ul>
<li>Doc/Docx/Word</li>
<li>XLS/XLSX</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>PPT/PPTX</li>
</ul>

We also ensure smooth download support with Gutenberg support in this document embedder plugin. You will get a separate setting panel where you will be able to change the preference of yours. Besides that, we also support any internal/external/Google Drive Link in this plugin.

PDF embedder is one of the most commonly used items in the wordpress website. Our plugin will help you to make that thing much more easier and smooth. Other plugins may make your website heavy and make the loading speeding slow. But we have optimized this plugin from those issues. So, you can use the plugin without any interruption. 

Most of the blogging websites need a doc file to embed for showing different sources for references. Beside that, you may need to show different articles or reference papers on your website. By using this document embedder you can keep your website light-weight via not uploading the raw file.

Additionally, in many corporate and business websites you may need to show the data and annual report which are in excel or in pdf format. This plugin will help you to showcase those things easily as you like. Rather creating a heavy weight css design you just need to add the file just via this plugin.     

We are continuously testing and updating this plugin so that you will be able to get the premium features in the coming days. We are also sure that you will not face any problem after enabling this plugin.

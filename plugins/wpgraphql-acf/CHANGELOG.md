## 2.1.0

## Upgrade Notice

While fixing some [performance issues](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql-acf/pull/152) we had to adjust the fallback logic for mapping ACF Field Groups to the Schema if they do not have "graphql_types" defined.

ACF Field Groups that did not have "graphql_types" defined AND were assigned to Location Rules based on "post_status", "post_format", "post_category" or "post_taxonomy" _might_ not show in the Schema until their "graphql_types" are explicitly defined.

## New Features

- [#156](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql-acf/pull/156): feat: Use published ACF values in resolvers for fields associated with posts that use the block editor, since the Block Editor has a bug preventing meta from being saved for previews. Adds a debug message if ACF fields are queried for with "asPreview" on post(s) that use the block editor.

## v2.0.0-beta.4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

#### Hook / Filter Name Changes

This release contains breaking changes. Action and Filter names have been renamed to be more consistent across the codebase and to follow a "namespace" pattern similar to core ACF.

If you have custom code that was hooking into / filtering WPGraphQL for ACF, check your hook names.

There's a table documenting the name changes here: [https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql-acf/pull/67#issue-1818715865](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql-acf/pull/67#issue-1818715865)


#### LocationRules namespace change

The LocationRules class has changed from `\WPGraphQL\Acf\LocationRules` to `\WPGraphQL\Acf\LocationRules\LocationRules`. It's unlikely that you have custom code referencing this class, but if you do, you'll need to update references.

### New Features

- [#67](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql-acf/pull/67): [BREAKING] feat: introduce new hook and filter names to reduce chances of conflicting with custom code extending the previous version of the plugin.

### Chores / Bugfixes

- [#68](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql-acf/pull/68): fix: fieldGroupName was always returning null
- [#69](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql-acf/pull/69): fix: graphql_description default value incorrect
- [#73](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql-acf/pull/73): fix: replace filter_input with sanitize_text_field

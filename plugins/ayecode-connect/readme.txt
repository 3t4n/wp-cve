AyeCode Connect once linked to our site allows you to install any purchased AyeCode Ltd product add-ons without a zip file. It also installs and activates licences automatically, so there is no need to copy/paste licenses.

== Description ==

To take full advantage of this plugin you should have one of our plugins installed.

[GeoDirectory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geodirectory/) | [UsersWP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/userswp/) | [WP Invoicing](https://wordpress.org/plugins/invoicing/)

AyeCode Connect is a service plugin, meaning that it will have no functionality until you connect your site to ours. This link allows us to provide extra services to your site such as live documentation search and submission of support tickets.
After connecting your site you can install our update plugin which will give you the ability to automatically sync license keys of purchases and also be able to remotely install and update purchased products.

You will be able to remotely manage your activated sites and licences all from your account area on our site.

You can also use our one click demo importer.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.7 or greater
* PHP version 5.6 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option. To do an automatic install of AyeCode Connect, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "AyeCode Connect" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our plugin you install it by simply clicking Install Now.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex will tell you more [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should seamlessly work. We always suggest you backup up your website before performing any automated update to avoid unforeseen problems.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes, please see our [terms & conditions](https://ayecode.io/terms-and-conditions/) and [privacy policy.](https://ayecode.io/privacy-policy/)

= Do i need to pay to use this? =

No, you can register a free account on our site which will provide you with live documentation search and the ability to get support directly from your wp-admin area.

= Is my connection to your site safe? =

Yes, our system will only connect via HTTPS ensuring all passed data is encrypted.
Additionally, we built our systems in such a way that;
Should your database or our database (or both) be compromised, this would not result in access to your site.
Should your files or our files (or both) be compromised, this would not result in access to your site.

= Your demo importer is not working? =

If your host runs "mod security" on your hosting and has some specific additional rules active, this can block some of our API calls. Please contact our support for help with this.

Attach files during checkout process with ease. Easy Upload Files During Checkout is a free plugin with a few premium features. It provides the facility of attaching files with orders during checkout. You can set display for uploading button on cart page, checkout page or checkout page after notes. For product pages, you will need premium version. Some check boxes on settings page to attach or detach billing/shipping details, order comments, secure file links and enable upload after login/register. You can also choose a checkbox to send attachments in email.
You can control allowed files types on settings page like doc,txt,jpeg,png in an input text field. You can set upload file required with toggle button and specify maximum upload size in Megabytes on settings page. Example is available there. It provides secure storage for your upload files/directories with Amazon, it's a new and premium feature. Setup your account on Amazon and get safe and secure storage for your important uploads. The premium version allows you to upload multiple files, change loading animation and display browse button on product page. It also provides an optional tab, with that tab you can select products which you want to whiteflag for upload files. By default, it is enabled for all products.

If you want new users to provide some required information (ID, resume etc.) you can enable new users to upload file(s) while registering even for the first time. On settings tab check the radio button "Registration Page" next to "Display on:" and browse button will appear on registration page. If you make upload field required, a warning message will appear that  file is not uploaded.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What are the orphan files? And how does this plugin handles orphan files? =

What happens if a customer doesn't complete the order but he has uploaded the file? Does that file gets deleted automatically?

These files are not deleted automatically. There is a tab named "Orphan Files" which will show all the orphan files either actually exist or recorded in database only and removed from the server. Select "Fetch Statistics" and click scan button to load statistics. Select "Fetch Orphan Files" and click "Scan the Database" button to load all orphan files. You can delete all orphan files in this tab, if you want.

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H3i69PX7uQ]

= Is this compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Yes, it is compatible with all WordPress themes which are developed according to the WordPress theme development standards. 

= How can i report an issue to the plugin author? =

It's better to post on support forum but if you need it be fixed on urgent basis then you can reach me through my blog too. You can find my blog link above.

= What are the basic or free features offered? =

In basic version you can upload one file, restrict file-type, set error message and caption text, disable or enable extra fields on checkout page. You can display upload field on cart page and checkout page.

= What are the exenteded or premium features offered? =

Premium features are those in which you might will need some customizations and it would require my input in term of time and cost. Like, a number of loading animations are provided so you can match them with your WordPress theme or choice. You can allow uploading multiple files. Upload directory can be changed over and over again without any conflict with the previous directory path. 

You can display upload fields on Product page as well. Obviously this feature will involve more complexity and reporting details, that's why it's a premium feature. 

You can restrict the image file dimensions as well, it's another complex area and you can have some different request as another improvement.

= May i restrict the upload files to a few selected products only? =

Yes. By default all products will have upload fields but if you will select any checkbox so it will be restricted to the allowed/checked products only. Don't forget that upload field will only work when a user will select a product for cart. It means, it only consider the items which are added to cart. Quantity doesn't matter though.

There are three pages which can have upload file display. 
1) Single Product Page
2) Cart Page
3) Checkout Page

Condition: If a product is in the cart so because of that product permission status, upload fields will be displayed or simply do not select any checkbox and it will work for all. 

Above all, i am always open to your suggestions. Either you use FREE or PREMIUM version, whoever suggest me a feature so i acknowledge the name in changelog with thanks. This plugin reached at this level with all of your help and suggestions.

= How Amazon S3 backup feature work? =

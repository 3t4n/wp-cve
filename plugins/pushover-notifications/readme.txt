Currently supports notifications for new users, comments, pingback/trackbacks, user specific password reset notifications, plugin and theme upgrades, core upgrades, notifying authors of comments on their posts, and post publication notifications for registered users.

You can expand Pushover Notifications for WordPress further with extensions available at https://wp-push.com/extensions/

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to buy the app for iOS or Android =

Yes, this plugin requires that you buy the application from the Google Play or Apple App store to connect with the Pushover.net account.

= Why do I have to register an Application with Pushover? =

I have been in contact with the Pushover Team and we agreed that in order to maintain a system that allows more managability and customization for you, the end user, each site should register their own application. This will allow you to set your own icon and not be limited by the monthly limitations of the API that are currently set, amongst other things.

== Future Plans ==

If you have a plugin you'd like to see integrated with Pushover Notifications for WordPress, comment in the forums.

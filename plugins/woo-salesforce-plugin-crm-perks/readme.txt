WooCommerce Salesforce Plugin allows you to quickly integrate WooCommerce Orders with Salesforce CRM.

== Description ==

Easily create leads, contacts or any object in Salesforce when an order is placed via WooCommerce. Learn more at [crmperks.com](https://www.crmperks.com/plugins/woocommerce-plugins/woocommerce-salesforce-plugin/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=directory&utm_campaign=readme)


== WooCommerce Salesforce Integration Setup ==

* Go to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Salesforce tabÂ then add new account.
* Go to WooCommerce -> Salesforce Feeds tab then create new feed.
* Map required Salesforce fields to WooCommerce Order fields.
* Send your test entry to Salesforce CRM.
* Go to WooCommerce -> Salesforce Logs and verify, if entry was sent to Salesforce.

**Connect Salesforce Account**

You can connect Salesforce Account by Oauth 2.0 or Salesforce Organization ID if API is not enabled. Also you can connect multiple Saleforce accounts.

**Fields Mapping**

Simply Select Salesforce CRM Object then map WooCommerce Order/product/user fields to Salesforce Object(Account, Lead, Contact, Case, custom Object etc) fields.

**Export Event**

Choose event, when WooCommerce Order data should be sent to Salesforce. For example , send WooCommerce Order to Salesforce when Order Status changes to "processing".

**Primary Key**

Instead of creating new Object in salesforce, you can update old object by setting Primary Key field.

**Error Reporting**

If there is an error while sending data to Salesforce, an email containing the error details will be sent to the specified email address.

**CRM Logs**

Plugin saves detailed log of each entry whether sent or not sent to to Salesforce and easily resend an entry to Salesforce.

**Send Historical Orders/Customers to Salesforce**

Easily export all old woocommerce orders and Customers to Salesforce in just one click. This feature is available in pro version only. 

**Full Synchronization**

All Woocommerce Orders/Customers/Products are fully synchronized with Salesforce. If you update/delete/restore an order that order will be updated/deleted/restored in Salesforce. You can import Products from Salesforce to Woocommerce too.

**Filter Orders**

By default all orders are sent to Salesforce, but you can apply filters & setup rules to limit the orders sent to Salesforce. For example sending Orders from specific city to Salesforce.

**Send Data As Notes**

You can send one to many WooCommerce Order fields data as an object Note in salesforce.

**Assign Objects**

An Object created/updated by one feed can be assigned to the Object created/updated by other feed. for example , you can assign Contact to Account or Order

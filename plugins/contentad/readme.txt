Content.ad serves billions of impressions across thousands of sites every month. The WordPress plugin is the quickest and easiest way to get Content.ad up and running on your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How quickly does it start working? =
The Content.ad Widget will start to work immediately; however, part of the optimization process involves learning which of your content performs the best. A certain number of impressions must be served before the widget is able to fully optimize and display the most effective content.

= Does Content.ad work on web sites in any language? =
Currently, the tool will only work properly on English language websites.

= Will the widget slow down my site? =
No. The Content.ad widget is designed to load _"asynchronously"_. This means your page will load independently of the widget script.

= I have sponsored content on my site with clicks but donâ€™t see any revenue. =
Revenue is based on actions not clicks.  Sponsored content served through the system won't generate revenue unless the user performs a particular action on the advertisers site _(ex. Signs up for a service or purchases something)_. When this happens the payout is generally much better than what you expect to see from a pay-per-click advertisement. This means that you might need to let the widget run for a while to start seeing revenue.

= I've configured my widget to display sponsored content but don't see them in the widget. =
Content.ad only displays sponsored content on approved domains. This means new sites could take 24 to 48 hours before sponsored content starts getting served. Once your site has been reviewed you will be notified.

= How do I control ad placement? =
On the Content.ad plugin widget settings page, hover over a widget name and you will an option for _"placement"_.  Selecting this option will open a placement configuration page. Options include, showing the widget above your content, below your content, in a WordPress widget _(sidebar, footer etc.)_ and only showing it on certain types of pages like the homepage, category page or post pages.

= Can I display Content.ad content in a sidebar or footer? =
Yes. Set the placement for a Content.ad widget to _"widget"_. In your WordPress widget settings drag the Content.ad widget into your sidebar or footer area.

= Does the Content.ad plugin work with Multisite? =
Not at this time. [Let Us Know](http://help.content.ad) if Multisite support is important to you.

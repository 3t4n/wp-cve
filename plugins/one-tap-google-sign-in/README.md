<h1>Wordpress plugin for One Tap Google Sign-in and Sign-up</h1>
Plugin Link: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-tap-google-sign-in/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-tap-google-sign-in/</a>
<p>Allows users to add Google One Tap Sign-in Or Sign-up to wordpress website. Shows One Tap Login Widget to users who are already logged in their google account in the browser.</p>

Note: This is not a replacement to the Sign-in with google option. Since this wont work if third party cookies are blocked. And if the user is not logged in google already. So consider this a alternate option for getting user signup to the site quickly.

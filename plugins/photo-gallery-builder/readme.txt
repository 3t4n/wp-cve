**Masonry Design**

The term Masonry layout probably owes its name to the popular jQuery Masonry plugin that is used to generate this type of layout. Masonry layout is also referred to as the Pinterest Style Layout

Masonry is a grid layout based on columns. Unlike other grid layouts, it doesnâ€™t have fixed height rows. Basically, Masonry layout optimizes the use of space inside the web page by reducing any unnecessary gaps. 

Without this type of layout, certain restrictions are required to maintain the structure of layout.

**Gallery/Content-Popup**

The view helps to demonstrate images in modern blocks with their titles below the image. On hover you can see a search loop to view the image in lightbox and a View More button next to each Title.

After clicking on the image appears a popup slider with a featured image on left and thumbnail images on the right with a description and URL below.


**Image Grid**

Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange depending on the screen size: On a big screen it might look better with the content organized in three columns, but on a small screen it would be better if the content items were stacked on top of each other.

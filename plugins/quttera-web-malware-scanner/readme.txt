== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this plugin different from similar plugins? =

This plugin uses Quttera's unique, patented, malware scanning and detection technology. The scanning engine employs a multi-layered, heuristic approach to gather the intelligence from the analyzed system and digest it into weighted rules to flag a piece of code as malicious. A self-learning mechanism uses Quttera's threats intelligence database crowd-sourced from a worldwide network to update the ruleset and improve detection with each subsequent run. 

= What is the heuristic scan? =

Standard or traditional scanning relies on the signature matching mechanisms. In which the signature of the known threat or its polymorphed variant is compared with the contents (string, e.g.) of the examined file. This technique relies on the existence of the signature in the database to enable the detection. Heuristic approach implements rules, weight-based systems, emulators, flow analyzers, statistical and mathematical methods when probing specific instructions, commands or any other portion of the software. As a result, it allows detecting the potentially malicious functionality in new (previously unknown) malware.


= What to do if plugin detects something suspicious? =

Quttera technology encompasses heuristic and self-learning components. The severity of the detection depends on the danger it can potentially pause. Current implementation offers four (4) severity levels: Clean, Potentially Suspicious, Suspicious and Malicious. If you are not sure whether Potentially Suspicious or Suspicious detection is an actual threat, our team will help you with that. You can contact us via any of the following: a ticket at https://helpdesk.quttera.com, email to support@quttera.com or through the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/quttera-web-malware-scanner/">Support Forum </a>.

= Where can I get support for this plugin? =

You can contact us via any of the following: a ticket at https://helpdesk.quttera.com, email to support@quttera.com or through the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/quttera-web-malware-scanner/">Support Forum </a>.

= What to do in case of False-Positives? =

Report False-Positive to our <a href="https://helpdesk.quttera.com/open.php">helpdesk</a>, and we will review and fix it within the 3-4 working days.

= How to submit samples that plugin did not detect? =

Please submit any missing detection to our <a href="https://helpdesk.quttera.com/open.php">helpdesk</a>.

= Why when I click Start Scan the screen freezes and then goes blank? =

That usually occurs when there is only one PHP worker assigned to the site. When the plugin runs, it occupies one PHP worker for the scan. Since there are no extra PHP workers available, the plugin blocks the website until the scan is finished.

= Do you offer paid services? =
Yes, we offer website security plans to protect the sites from malware and blacklisting, fix hacking and improve the overall cybersecurity risks management for web assets.

= Why when I click Scan Now nothing happens? =

A front-end code interacts with the backend code of this plugin through the HTTP request sent by loaded JavaScript functionality (code). Please verify that you have JavaScript enabled and that the firewall doesn't block these requests.

= How can I send you the investigation report? =

Click "Download Report" button to generate the report, store it as a text file and send it to us via <a href="https://helpdesk.quttera.com/open.php">helpdesk</a>.

= Why when I run an internal scan, the scanned files count shows 0 (zero)? =

The plugin scheduler invocation is based on WordPress Cron mechanism. 
Some web hostings and servers do not enable the functionality required for WordPress Cron mechanism to work correctly.
There is a way to overcome this limitation by using alternative WordPress Cron. To enable alternative Cron, please add the following line to wp-config.php

  define('ALTERNATE_WP_CRON', true);

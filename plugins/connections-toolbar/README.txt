Adds useful admin links and resources for the Connections Business Directory plugin to the WordPress Toolbar / Admin Bar.

== Description ==

This is an extension plugin for the [Connections Business Directory Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/connections/). Quick click access without having to scroll to all of Connections admin pages from either the admin or the front end for easy management. You can even go to a specific settings tab of filter the entry list with a single click making you life easier.

Why not just include this with the plugin as an option? Two reasons, the admin bar has limited space and to limit the amount of core plugin options and code.

Here are some other great **free extensions** (with more on the way) that enhance your experience with the business directory:

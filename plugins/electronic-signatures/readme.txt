This plugin helps integrate **Electronic Signature** on SwiftCloud.ai with Wordpress.

== Description ==

SwiftCloud offers [shortcode] style E-Sign. Typical WP use = WP >> Doc >> Back to WP. 

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9eLFDv8sDg]

TIP: We have Sign & Pay. You can get payment (Stripe) and signature in 1 step.

The doc will have your logo, colors, even a mapped domain, but due to JS/CSS obfuscation, the actual signature happens on our server.

Start with Why...
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M31nTifljYc]

Wordpress-Style <a href="https://swiftcloud.ai">Electronic Signature</a> Setup

**10 MINUTE SETUP**

TIP: FREE SETUP - we'll do it for you. Our onboarding with AI is still in process. Just email your doc to Support@SwiftCRM.com. We can even setup a demo first to test.

Do this: (Example Liability Waiver setup here)
1. Start your free 7 day trial - <a href="https://buy.stripe.com/3csg1f4RQ1o94Q8fZ6">Annual </a>(4mo Free! Save 30%) or <a href="https://buy.stripe.com/bIYeXbesqd6R2I0eV3">Monthly</a>.

2. Fill out your <a href="https://swiftcloud.co/settings">main settings</a>. Add your Wordpress URL into the "Website (Work)" field.
Click About Your Company >> Branding and add a Logo, so people feel like they're in the right place.

3. Go to the <a href="https://swiftcloud.co/drive">main drive</a> and click Add New >> Doc. 

4. Copy and paste your waiver into that doc. Add the following shortcodes to the end:
Name: [swift_name_both name="swift_name_both" role="participant" required] Email:Â [swift_email role="participant"]
[swiftsignature required role="participant" size="medium" type="Both"]
[swift_date who="yours" localdate="MMDDYYYY" format="long" readonly role="participant"]

5. Set the pink box and blue box settings however you like (for confirmation to signer + notification to you).
TIP: People often start on Wordpress, then sign on our servers, then go back to your Wordpress.

6. Click Save, then click Preview. Link to the URL in the beige box and you're done!

This plugin is helpful but not needed. It will soon show logging of people who signed.

If you need payment, we have Sign & Pay in 1 step - see below & reach out for help if needed.



NOTE: <a href="https://swiftcloud.ai/waivers/">Electronic Waivers</a> are lower cost than regular e-Sign - we have separate pricing for waivers and <a href="https://swiftcloud.ai/petition">petitions</a>.

PDF eSign vs . Smart Doc (responsive phone friendly + better):
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDSj9w-mnew]

First, a commercial. It's quick & shows the power of the platform...

**9 CRITICAL e-SIGN CONSIDERATIONS**

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-lIZK66f8w]

**2 MAIN THINGS TO KNOW QUICKLY:**
1. **The actual signature happens on our server** (branded to you, **your logo**, colors...). We must be able to legally guarantee (in court if needed) the signer intent, and we will never do that if the code is on your server. Most common: Wordpress >> eSign (and now maybe also sign and pay) on our server >> back to your WP site / thanks page.
2. **There is no free plan**. We have a $1 trial (14 Days), and plans are very affordable, but this is a paid system.

If you are cool with those 2 caveats, let's get you set up - it's a great, powerful system.

**NOTE: This plugins just helps with config, confirmation-page thanks, reporting. Actual e-Sign is off-domain for security (legally required, see below)**

We could not allow potential CSS obfuscation of contracts, as well as solve every possible interference from themes or plugins, so the actual e-sign now happens on our servers, though these can be fully branded to you and even cname-mapped i.e. https://Secure.YourDomainHere.com etc.

TIP: Agencies, Devs see <a href="https://buy.stripe.com/3csg1f4RQ1o94Q8fZ6" target="_new">https://swiftcloud.ai/partners</a>

Another upside: Having an independent 3rd party hold your signed docs may be legally superior due to potential modification attacks and thus holding your own signed docs may not be legally defensible. For more information about this we recommend independent licensed legal advice.

SwiftCloud is perfect for sales contracts, liability waivers, permission slips, and more.

Note this plugin requires a <a href="https://buy.stripe.com/3csg1f4RQ1o94Q8fZ6" target="_new">SwiftCloud Account</a> for the electronic signatures to work. PDFs will be stored online in your signed wordpress page.

Our number 1 goal for this plugin is as part of a sales stack.


**Electronic Signature FEATURES**

1. Legally binding electronic signature, timedate stamped with audit trail for court enforcement. Paid accounts have additional features for court deposition or appearance.
2. Single-page mode: Input form + electronic signature(s) on the same page (most common and simple)
3. Multi-page mode: Multi-step / Multi-Page Forms or where the signor info (i.e. name, price, etc.) is pre-filled (from CRM or another webform, even Excel spreadsheet, etc.) i.e. capture your users one form 1, then fill that into an electronic signature contract on step 2.
4. Can be included in a multi-step flow such as input form, then payment, then signature, or signature then payment, etc.
5. Signed documents are archived and held in trust by Swift Signature should court enforcement be needed
6. Multi-Party Consecutive or Concurrent (all-or-none, or partial allowed) signatures (Premium account required)
7. Notification and Automation options - add autoresponders, payment flows, and more
8. Sales flow sessions options available (i.e. real-time phone handoff to a client)
9. Conditional Logic: Show/Hide sections based on a checkbox, radio button option, circle-word (a type of radio button, technically, similar to circling answers on paper forms)
10. Editable / NonEditable fields for use with CRMs and other forms - pre-fill fields like name, email and allow the user to edit, and optionally pre-fill other fields but lock them as non-editable (i.e. purchase price, loan terms, etc.). TIP: Use these to pre-fill a price or terms into a sales contract, and it will look like regular text (not an input.. unless you want it to).

More Help: See https://swiftcrm.com/support/tag/e-sign for our latest updates or help if with debugging and setup.

**SALES USE**

Note Swift Signature can be used for anything. You can even Sign and Pay (payment + signature at the same time), embed invoices into a doc (i.e. sales proposal), pre-fill a complex application form then hand it over for e-Sign, etc.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGZw3lLwG5s]

The system is designed to allow pre-filling variables (as regular text i.e. for prices or visibly-editable fields (a user's name)).

Certain fields can be read-write (i.e. their name, in case the sales rep spells it wrong), others can be read-only (deal terms), then signed online. If needed, the sales rep could then further modify the data in SwiftCRM, and generate a final signable agreement.

== Installation ==
You probably know the drill by now, but if not, here's a step by step suggestion.

**NOTE: The actual signature must happen on our server** (with your logo, colors, even subdomain) in order to be legally binding. We must be able to guarantee, in court if needed, the signer intent, and we will never do that if the code is on your server. This plugin just helps with the thanks-confirmation and reporting.

1. Upload the `Electronic Signatures` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or better yet, use Wordpress' native installer at Plugins >> Add New >> (search SwiftCloud)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click yes to create a thanks-page if you like, or get the URL of whatever page you want the user to land on after they sign.
4. See the video below to setup your doc. Link your WP site to it.
5. Inside SwiftCloud, set the pink-box after-signature action to return your user to a wordpress page.

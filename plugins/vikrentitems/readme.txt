Multi-purpose Items Rental Management System for any kind of objects. The most efficient booking solution for managing items rentals through your website.

== Description ==

= Vik Rent Items for WordPress =

The flexible yet powerful rental management system is now available also for WordPress as a native plugin!

This is the perfect plugin if you need to set up a reservation system for renting items of any kind, from bikes to large items, equipments, sport tools, storage rooms, storage box or anything else that requires an availability calendar for rentals.

Vik Rent Items was born in 2012 for a different web-software (CMS) than WordPress. The same powerful and experienced framework is now at the service of all webmasters, designers and web-agencies that work with WordPress.

The main differences with its brother plugin "Vik Rent Car" is that Vik Rent Items allows to book multiple items with the same order, also with multiple quantities if the items allow the choice of the units to book.

No matter if you want to rent small or large items, in single or multiple quantities, for short or long terms (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly), Vik Rent Items will fulfill all your needs.

This is the **free** version of the plugin, but you can upgrade to the **Pro** version at any time from your *wp-admin* section. Experience the power of a robust items rental management system!

Works with any theme for WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is upgrading to Pro mandatory? =

No, not at all. However, it took our company around 8 years to build the *Pro* version and we are willing to spend a lot more years of work on this software. We encourage you to evaluate the free version first, and then upgrade to Pro to unlock its potential.

= Why some functions are not available in the free version? =

We are a software development company that constantly works to deliver professional tools to build up websites. We make money by selling licenses of the Pro version.

= Is it worth upgrading to Pro? =

VikRentItems is not a one-page plugin. You can build websites worth a lot of money with this plugin. You don't need anything else to deliver a complete website, if not a Theme and some experience with WordPress.

= Can I use VikRentItems with my preferred Theme? =

Yes, of course. You are free to install Vik Rent Items on your website with your own Theme. The plugin will adjust to it thanks to its own CSS framework. It is also possible to work on a custom CSS file to adjust some layouts.

= What's the main difference with Vik Rent Car? =

Many functions of Vik Rent Items and Vik Rent Car are pretty similar. However, the biggest difference is that with Vik Rent Items you can allow your clients to rent multiple items (for the same dates) with the same order, as well as items with multiple units. Vik Rent Car instead was mainly designed for vehicles, where, for example, only one car per order could be rented. If you need to allow a family to book multiple bycycle with one single order, maybe 2 "Mountain Bikes" and 3 "Bikes for Kids", then Vik Rent Items will work perfectly. This is also a plugin designed for generic items, not specifically for vehicles, and so it can adjust to literally any kind of items, things or objects for rent.

Change the colors of the WordPress media player directly from the Customizer.

== Description ==

The WordPress media player is great, but the default styling doesn't fit into too many themes. Couple that with the fact that there aren't a lot of theme developers who add custom styles for the media player and you have the need for Media Player Style Kit - a simple way to change your media player colors without writing a single line of code.

**Features**

- Easily editable colors in the familiar Customizer interface
- No need to write custom CSS or any other code
- Live previews of color changes inside the Customizer
- Replaces the media player buttons with the WordPress Dashicons font for easy customization

Media Player Style Kit will work with any WordPress site. It will customize the display of the built-in WordPress media player and not media players added by other plugins/themes.

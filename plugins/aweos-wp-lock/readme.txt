### AWEOS WP Lock: Put your site in maintenance mode if needed

Is your website still under development? Have you broken anything on your webpage? WP Lock has you covered, use our simple admin bar widget to lock your site when needed.

We let you define a specific timespan to unlock and lock your site again, this can be useful if you want to show your work to a client, co-worker or friend.

After installation, you can use the "WP Lock" settings section inside your admin bar to lock or unlock your site. We indicate that your site is either locked or public by using a green or red color which makes it clear to the developer and site admins if "WP Lock" is activated at this moment. 

If the plugin is enabled, you can only visit your website if you are logged as an administrator. Other people ('guests') will see a white page with just a short but customizable text notice rather than the website itself.

You can choose between 4 plugin states:

1.    Disable permanently<br>
The plugin is disabled forever - show the website for everyone (you can also deactivate the plugin as a whole to archive the same behavior)
2.    Enable permanently<br>
The plugin is enabled forever, for now. Use this setting to hide the website from 'guests', a green section of the admin bar will indicate that your site is offline.
3.    Disable for [TIME]<br>
Configure a manual timeframe in X minutes, hours, days or weeks where your site will be **open** for the specific duration. The site will jump back to a **locked** state after the defined time.
4.    Enable for<br>
Configure a manual timeframe in X minutes, hours, days or weeks where your site will be **locked** for the specific duration. The site will jump back to an **open** state after the defined time.

This plugin was developed by the advertising agency AWEOS.

Display Gravity Forms confirmation messages in a modal popup

== Description ==

This is an add-on to Gravity Forms that lets you display confirmation messages (aka thank you messages) in a nice, customisable popup. It nicely integrates to each Gravity Forms existing confirmation setting page. Additionally, you can also fire custom Javascript when a confirmation message is loaded in popup for event tracking purposes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `confirmation-popup-for-gravity-forms.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. DO NOT change the name of the `confirmation-popup-for-gravity-forms` folder
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Navigate to `Forms` and edit those Gravity Forms you wish to enable modal text confirmation

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work if `Confirmation Type` is `Page` or `Redirect`? =

No. Confirmation messages will only be displayed on popup if Confirmation Type is set to `Text`

= Can I display confirmation text in a modal popup in select Gravity Forms? 

Yes. You can selectively enable this feature to some forms only. 

== Screenshots ==

1. This add-on nicely integrates with existing Gravity Forms Text Confirmation setting page. Enable or disable popup when needed. Optionally, you can add additional script to run if confirmation text is loaded.
2. Confirmation message is displayed in a modal popup (can be customised)

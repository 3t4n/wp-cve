== Description == 
Turn your site into the game of Asteroids. Click to start and you can destroy 
the contents of your webpage by flying around and shooting them. Check out 
Electric Tree House (http://electrictreehouse.com/) (bottom of the right sidebar) 
to try it out yourself. The plugin is also highly customizable allowing you to add
a description and/or image as well as controlling which pages the Asteroids widget
 appears on. Give it a try and I guarantee you will be impressed. The Widget 
implements a javascript by Erik Rothoff Andersson (http://erkie.github.com/),
 based on the classic game, Asteroids.

3. Use the widget like any other widget.
4. Customize based on your preference. A little bit of editing and you can remove my links from the widget entirely.

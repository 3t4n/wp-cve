Integrates the Events Manager and WPML plugins together to provide a smoother multilingual experience (Requires Events Manager and WPML)

== Description ==

This plugin helps make [Events Manager](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/events-manager/) and [WPML](http://wpml.org) work better together by allowing translation of all event-related features:

** Version 2.0 is a major revamp that fixes *all known issues*, nuances and limitiation. 2.0 enables *full compatiblity* with [Events Manager](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/events-manager/) and [Events Manager Pro Add-ons](https://eventsmanagerpro.com) **

* Detects translated pages of specific EM pages (assigned in Events > Settings > Pages) and displays relevant language content
* Searching locations and events within the context of the current language being viewed.
* Recurring events can be created in multiple languages, recurrence translations are correctly created.
* Event translations will share relevant information across all translations, including
 * Event Times
 * Location Information
  * If translations for the location exist, translated events will show/link to location of the same language, if not the original location translation.
 * Bookings and Booking Forms
 * If you delete an event that is the originally translated event, booking and other meta info is transferred to default language or next available language translation.
* Location address information can be translated, whilst sharing coordinate, country/zip information accross translations.
* Event-related text can be translated for each language including:
    * Custom texts, emails templates and formats on the settings page.
    * Booking and attendee custom forms (available in Pro)
    * Custom event and gateway emails (available in Pro)
* MultiSite cross-site support, including showing events from other blogs in your network when EM Global Tables Mode is enabled.
* Displaying untranslated items in lists or hiding them, according to WPML settings.

= Special Installation Steps =
Please ensure that WPML 4.2 and EM 5.6.7 or higher are installed BEFORE updating or activating this plugin.

When setting up EM and WPML, you should create translated versions of the event, location, category, tag, etc. pages assigned in Events > Settings > Pages of your admin area. Duplicating them using WPML is enough.

Given the flexibiltiy of both plugins, there is an huge number of possible setting/language combinations to test, and despite our rigorous testing it is impossible to test every setting combination and scenario. To the best of our knowledge, we have achieved 100% compatibility, but should you come across on your setup and we'll do our best to fix them as time permits.
 
== Installation ==

This plugin requires WPML and Events Manager to be installed BEFORE installing this plugin.

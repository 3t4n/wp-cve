Additional layouts are contained in the [Pro version!](https://goldplugins.com/special-offers/upgrade-to-company-directory-pro/ "Upgrade to Company Directory Pro")

Company Directory supports searching staff members with a simple search form - a great feature if you have many employees in your directory!  Adding a Staff Search widget to your sidebar allows visitors to quickly find the employee they are looking for.

Company Directory allows you to include many pieces of information for each Staff or Faculty member, including their:

* Full Name

* Last Name
* Job Title
* Phone Number
* Email Address
* Mailing Address

= Display Your Staff and Faculty in an Easy to View Format =

Company Directory includes a useful Staff List view for displaying your Staff Members.  Visitors will be able to click through from your Staff List views to read more about each employee in a customizable template.

Company Directory Pro includes additional attractive layouts such as the Staff Grid or customizable Staff Table layout, which gives user the option to control what fields are displayed.  This is a great way to display a staff phone directory!

= Templating System allows Complete Customization =

Company Directory uses a customizable template system to allow full control over the look and feel of Staff Members.  Does your business have a large staff or faculty?  Company Directory includes Search functionality to facilitate users finding the person they are looking for, without having to navigate long tables and lists of staff.

= Easy to Use Features Simplify Administration =

Managing and displaying a large amount of Faculty or Staff on your website can be difficult - especially when using traditional methods such as editing HTML on a page.  With Company Directory, users are given an easy-to-understand method of adding and managing Staff and Faculty on their website, using the WordPress interface we all know and love.

Using our simple staff shortcode system, website maintainers can insert a list of staff, an employee table, or grid of faculty members onto any WordPress Page!  This allows visitors to view your Staff or Faculty, find who they are looking for, and contact them directly!

Our professional development team is continually improving and updating our plugin, so stay tuned for updates!

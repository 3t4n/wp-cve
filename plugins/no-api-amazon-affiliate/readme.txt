No API Amazon Affiliate allows you to create nice boxes to sell your Amazon Affiliate products <strong>without api key</strong> and make money. Easy affiliate tool for everyone!

Add formatted Amazon Products to any page or post using only the ASIN product id, without programming. No amazon AWS keys, no code, no css knowledge.

The best option for Amazon affiliate programs. It allows you to easily configure the button style that you like, the background color, show the rating with stars, comments, image for prime products.

<strong>ATTENTION: the only contribution is a percentage of your links will be modified to target the developer tag.</strong> It is not a percentage of the clicks, it is a percentage of the links that are shown, win-win. Currently the percentage is 7% although it is expected to be able to lower this figure depending on the use of the tool, more people using the plugin lower percentage, so share and leave us a 5 stars rating ðŸ™‚.

<strong>ATENCIÃ“N: la Ãºnica contribuciÃ³n es que un procentaje de links serÃ¡n modificados al tag del desarrollador.</strong> No es un un porcentaje de clicks, es un porcentaje de los links mostrados, win-win. Actualmente el porcentaje es del 7% aunque se espera disminuir en funciÃ³n del uso, mÃ¡s gente usando el plugin menor porcentaje, asÃ­ que comparte y dejanos 5 estrellas en la puntuaciÃ³n ðŸ™‚.

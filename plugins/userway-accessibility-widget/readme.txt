UserWay’s Accessibility Widget creates a simpler and more accessible browsing experience for your users.

== Description ==
Web accessibility can seem complex and overwhelming if you don’t know where to start.

Let us make it easier, and, to coin a phrase, more accessible for everyone. UserWay’s Accessibility Widget creates a simpler and more accessible browsing experience for your users while increasing compliance with WCAG 2.1, ATAG 2.0, European EN 301 549, ADA, & Section 508 requirements.

UserWay’s Accessibility Widget will strengthen any weak areas that could cause accessibility issues on your site. We are proud to say that a significant number of websites are more accessible today thanks to UserWay.

UserWay’s Accessibility Widget makes smart modifications to elements on your site that are identified as being non-compliant, that may prevent keyboard-only navigation, or are in violation of ADA regulations.

##### SECURE YOUR WEBSITE FROM THE LATEST VULNERABILITIES WITH THE EASY TO USE WEBSITE PENETRATION TESTING TOOL

**[Beagle Security](https://beaglesecurity.com/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=3rd_party&utm_campaign=integration "Beagle Security")** is a web application penetration testing tool that helps you to identify vulnerabilities on your WordPress website before hackers exploit them. 

35% of the web is built on WordPress and it's a favorite target for hackers. Vulnerabilities in the WordPress core, plugins, and themes can all leave your website prone to a cyber attack leading to loss of critical data and financial losses. 

That is why you need to proactively tackle WordPress website security and make sure you’re secure from common WordPress security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, file inclusion exploits, directory traversal, and many more.

With Beagle Security, you can find complex attack vectors WordPress vulnerability scanners fail to detect. Vulnerability scanners give you quick scan results, but they are not designed to identify modern security threats. 

By leveraging an AI-powered core, Beagle Security does in-depth penetration tests on your website and discovers all the loopholes in it. With evidence-based vulnerability reporting, you get insights into the occurrence of each vulnerability on your website and actionable recommendations on how to fix the discovered security issues and secure your website.

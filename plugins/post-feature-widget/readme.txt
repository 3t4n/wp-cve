With the Featured Post Widget you can put a certain post in the focus and style it differently.

== Description ==

The Featured Post Widget is a fully customizable widget, that displays a single post. You can decide, whether or not the post thumbnail is displayed, whether the post title is above or beneath the thumbnail and a couple of more things. And of course, you can style the widget individually.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `post-feature-widget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place and customize your widgets
4. Ready

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get the image more responsive ? =

If the widget container is smaller than the image size, the image will automatically be adjusted to the widget size. In other words, just choose some width for the image that is larger than your widget area and it will always have the right size.

= I styled the widget container myself and i looks bad. What do I do? =

The styling of the widget requires some knowledge of css. If you are not familiar with that, try adding

`padding: 10px;
margin-bottom: 10px;`
 
to the style section.

= My widget should have rounded corners, how do I do that? =

Add something like

`-webkit-border-top-left-radius: 5px;
-webkit-border-top-right-radius: 5px;
-moz-border-radius-topleft: 5px;
-moz-border-radius-topright: 5px;
border-top-left-radius: 5px;
border-top-right-radius: 5px;`
 
to the widget style. This is not supported by all browsers yet, but should work in almost all of them.

= My widget should have a shadow, how do I do that? =

Add something like

`-moz-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;
-webkit-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;
box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;`
 
to the widget style to get a nice shadow down right of the container. This is not supported by all browsers yet, but should work in almost all of them.

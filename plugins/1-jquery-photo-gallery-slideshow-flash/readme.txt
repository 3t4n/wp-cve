== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's the deal with HTML5 and jQuery (or is Flash dead) ? =

As you may already know Flash is out and HTML5 is in, Adobe (the creator of Flash) will no longer develop it for mobile devices and will start to develop on HTML5.

What this means for you is that every Flash gallery that you use in your blog will not work on iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod) and many of the Android devices. Most mobile phones will also not support Flash. All together you lose about 20% of your visitors (if your site is about mobile expect even more than 20%).

This plugin is all about the future and supporting any device out there, we do that by using native Javascript, jQuery and HTML5. In some cases (like video for example) the plugin will use Flash when supported by the browser but will switch to HTML5 when not.

** Stay away from Flash! **


= Do I need to register to any external service ? =

No, this plugin is completely integrated with Wordpress dashboard

Add beautiful podcast subscribe buttons anywhere.

== Description ==

This plugin helps to easily include 60+ custom and Podcast-specific Subscribe (follow) Buttons anywhere within your site with a simple shortcode. 
The Podcast Subscribe Buttons are intended for podcasters and therefore the list of companies/icons only include podcast-related companies. (Need a new icon? Let us know!)

With the Podcast Subscribe Buttons plugin, you could display links to subscribe to your podcast across various external podcast platforms, those links may include regular links to your pages on external podcast platforms, direct links to RSS feeds, or URI links to open directly in an external application. 

There are a few ways to add subscribe buttons with the plugin.
First, you can use the custom block in any page/post that uses the new ("Gutenberg") WordPress editor. 
Also, you can create new "Subscribe Button" sets via the menu that appears in your WordPress dashboard (under "Tools -> Podcast Subscribe Buttons"). Simply adjust the default display settings, add links, and display the button via a shortcode anywhere within your site. See example below:
`[podcast_subscribe id="1789"]`

Lastly, you can add the buttons directly via your theme or via a custom Elementor widget in case you use one of our [Podcast Themes](https://secondlinethemes.com/themes)

== Description ==

Have hundreds of products or blog posts on your websites and having trouble setting up/changing featured images for them? We identified the pain and developed a plugin that lets you do this with just a single click.

During one of our meetings, one of our clients mentioned that they are having trouble with featured images for their website or blog. Whenever images need to be changed or removed. It appears simple for a single post or product, but doing it manually for 100 images in different post thumbnails takes a huge amount of time. And they were having more than 10000+ blog posts on their site and changing images of all of them was becoming exhausting tasks for them.

Which late got converted into single-day tasks as they start using our easy-to-use and simple **Bulk Featured Image plugin**.

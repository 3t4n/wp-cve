== Installation ==
1. Upload `brainyquote_widget.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
1. Go to `Appearance`,  `Widgets` in WordPress.
1. Drag the `BrainyQuote Widget` to the sidebar, for example the `Main Widget Area` or the `Secondary Widget Area`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I add multiple quote widgets to my site? =
Yes!  Each time you add a widget, you can select the topic feeds you want to appear on your page. You could have one widget that displays the "Art Quote of the Day" and another widget
 below it displaying the "Nature Quote of the Day". 

= What versions of WordPress does this work with? =
We tested with 5.5.1, 4.9.8, 4.8.1, 4.6.1, 4.4.2, 3.8.1, 3.7.1, and 3.6.1 but it probably works with other versions (3.x or greater).  

Let us know in the "Compatibility" poll if it does work with a particular version, and let us know (via the Support tab) if there are any other issues. Thanks!

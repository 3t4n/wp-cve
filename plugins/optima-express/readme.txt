== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will the plugin work after I download and install it? =
You need to register the plugin in order for it to work. You can enter a registration code for an existing paid account, create a free trial account with sample listings from California for demonstration purposes, or purchase a new paid account for your MLS by accessing the "Registration" section of the plugin menu within the WordPress Dashboard.

= How do I access my back-end Control Panel? =
In your WordPress dashboard, go to the Optima Express plugin menu and select the "IDX Control Panel". From there you can manage IDX property search settings, manage your own listings, manage your leads, and more.

= Can anyone get an iHomefinder account? =
Only real estate professionals who are active members of a [supported MLS](https://www.ihomefinder.com/resources/idx-coverage?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Affiliates&utm_campaign=plugin_repository_page) can sign-up for a paid account with live MLS listings. If you don't see your MLS listed, please [contact us](https://www.ihomefinder.com/resources/contact-us?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Affiliates&utm_campaign=plugin_repository_page) about adding IDX service for your MLS.

= Are recently sold listings available in property search? =
Yes, in most locations we provide both active listings and recently sold listings from the MLS data, displayed separately in the search results.

= I receive new leads from other online services. Can I get them into my iHomefinder account? =
Our Premium + CRM plan will automatically import new leads from over [30 different online services](https://www.ihomefinder.com/features/integrations?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Affiliates&utm_campaign=plugin_repository_page), including Trulia and Zillow. And you can assign new leads to different [follow-up email campaigns](https://www.ihomefinder.com/features/real-estate-crm?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Affiliates&utm_campaign=plugin_repository_page) that you choose, based on their source. This ensures every new lead enters your follow-up text and email drip campaigns.

= Do I have to contact my MLS when signing up for an account? =
When you sign up for a paid account, we will send you the required steps and any relevant documents for IDX licensing with your MLS. We also submit your completed licensing paperwork to your MLS

= How long does it take to get MLS approval? =
Depending upon your MLS, approval can take anywhere from less than a business day to a week. While you're waiting for MLS approval you can test the Optima Express IDX plugin on your site with the provided demo IDX listing data.

= Where can I find out if my MLS is supported? =
Please refer to our current list of [supported MLSs](https://www.ihomefinder.com/resources/idx-coverage?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Affiliates&utm_campaign=plugin_repository_page).

= Does the plugin provide access to multiple MLSs? =
The plugin will provide IDX data for the MLSs you request when you sign up for your paid iHomefinder account. If you belong to more than one MLS, you can request service for additional MLSs at an additional cost.

= Will my site get SEO credit for IDX listings? =
Yes. The Optima Express + MarketBoost IDX plugin **doesn't "frame" property listing data** into your WordPress site. Instead, property listings appear directly under your domain, ensuring that your site gets full SEO credit. On any page or blog post, you can easily embed IDX map searches, Markets (unlimited galleries of listings that search engines will index, matching listing location and criteria you choose), Market Reports, and lead capture forms. This gives you the advantage of including your own custom content with IDX content, and full control over all SEO aspects of a page such as titles, keywords, and meta tags.

= Will Optima Express + MarketBoost work with a mobile device? =
When paired with a responsive WordPress theme, all website features are optimized for viewing on any device and screen size.

= What kind of lead capture tools are provided? =
Property detail pages include lead capture options such as Schedule a Showing, Request Info, and Save Property) and registration prompts can be presented through the property search experience with different trigger and strength settings (optional, forced, etc.). Leads can also register to receive daily email alerts for listings that match their chosen search criteria. You can also add a lead capture form to any of your own website pages, perfect for putting chosen content or downloads behind a registration form to collect new leads.

= Can I customize the locations that are available for searching on my website? =
You can control the geographic areas (neighborhoods, subdivisions, etc.) that appear in the auto-suggest list when users start typing in the Location field within the Eureka map search. You can also set up a Custom City List in your IDX Control Panel to control which cities appear when they click in the Location field.

= How frequently is the listing data updated? =
Our IDX property listing data is updated every two hours for most MLSs, and as frequently as every 15 minutes for some MLSs.

= Where can I learn more about the features and pricing? =
Please visit [our website](https://www.ihomefinder.com?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Affiliates&utm_campaign=plugin_repository_page) to learn more about our plan options and pricing. 

= Which WordPress themes do you recommend for use with Optima Express? =
Optima Express is compatible with most WordPress themes, and will automatically inherit the styling of your chosen theme. Unlike many other IDX plugins for WordPress, Optima Express looks great without requiring any styling or other adjustments. We recommend using a free trial account to test any themes you may be considering. This also allows you to make adjustments and customizations to your account that are saved when you convert your trial to a paid account.

= 8.6.01 =

* After frontend upload a js error appeared preventing the re-display.
* New shortcode arttribute: anon, when used, replaces the owners and item(photo) names by three dots. Especially usefull for contest display, but works on all [wppa] shortcodes.

2. You can no longer configure commenting for logged out visitors.
3. You can no longer have album and/or photo names in urls.
4. Album and photo item numbers in links are now always encrypted.

6. You can no longer enter html in comments.
7. You can ony edit your own last comment of the current photo as long as it is still in view.
* New shortcode attribute: meonly, when used, only albums / photos are shown that are owned by the current visitor. Works on all [wppa] shortcodes.

= 8.5.02 =

* New feature: Pdf conversion.
If your server has ImageMagick on board, and its external command 'convert', you can now convert pdf files to jpg files.
The purpose of tjhis new feature is the ability to avaoid the browser to open a pdf reader (including the download option that you might not want to be there),
and the possibility to display other pages than just the first.
When the pdf consists of only one page, it can be converted to a single image; a multiple page pdf can be converted to an album containing jpg images of all pages.
The name of the album will be the filename of the pdf without extension, the names of the jpg's will be like 'Page xx'; the sequence method of the album will be sequence #,
and the sequence numbers of the jpg's will be the physical page numbers, starting at 1. There are severtal options on how to start the page numbering (item names).
* New feature: Selectable occurrrence.
Each wppa shortcode has a unique identifier: the occurrance (mocc). This is basically the sequence number of the wppa dieplay on the page / on the widget area.
These numbers are automatically assigned and are basically only there for internal use. When one clicks on an item - like 'Slideshow' on an album cover -
the corresponding code is fetched from the server by an ajax call. When the code is received from the server, the ajax code knows by the occurrance number where to place it,
i.e. the content of which wppa container should be replaced by it.
Sometimes it is usedfull for the author of the page to decide himself what the number must be, so he has control over it and can refer to it.
The new shortcode attribute is simply 'mocc="x"' where x is an integer number > 100 and < 200. ( Wppa containers in widgets start at 201 ).
An example where you can use it for is as follows.
The shortcode option delay has now the ability to specify the container id mocc where to place the delayed contant.
It is only usefull for delay with a text or a button argument; the result is that the text or buttton stayes visible after the delayed content is placed on the page.
Example:
First the display of a single photo in container id 123
Then three textlinks to replace the photo by a slideshow in container 123, while the textlinks stay visible:

[wppa type="photo" photo="4711" mocc="123" size="0.7" align="left"]
[wppa type="slide" album="13" delay="text,See the slidehow,123"]
[wppa type="slide" album="14" delay="text,See the other show,123"]
[wppa type="slide" album="15" delay="text,Yet another show,123"]

* New feature: Inline settings directly in the shortcode.
There is a new shortcode attribute for the [wppa] shortcode: set
Syntax: set="name1:value1,name2:value2,..."
Works like the wppa_set shortcode, but is intented for delayed shortcodes where the wppa_set shortcode does not work.

= 8.5.01 =

* Fixed an issue with cached slideshow widgets.

Photo Albums -> Settings -> Links -> IV: Frontend download links.

Basic Settings -> Slideshow -> I -> Item 1 is set to a smaller size than the available width on the page.
* Plugin Disable Gutenberg has been added to the blacklist. It contains an inconsistency that the author refuses to fix, while it is very simple to do.
It causes front-end ajax in the normal mode to fail with a fatal error.
There is a good alternative for Disable Gutenberg: Classic Editor and Classic Widgets.
If you still want to use Disable Gutenberg, try a differend ajax method in Advanced settings -> System -> I -> Item 5: Ajax method.
However, this may disable frontend ajax if a different plugin denies frontend acces to wp-admin/admin-ajax.php.
If you want to patch Disable Gutenberg: Remove in disable-gutenberg.php: line 95: if (is_admin()) { and its corresponing } on line 108.

- Dropped all custom style items in Advanced settings -> System -> I. Use wp customizer instead.
- Dropped the use of the wp editor for multiline textfields on admin pages.
- Dropped frontend edit photo method 'Classic'.

* Removed Google+ share.
* Added round black share buttons. See Advanced settings -> Share -> I Items 7, 10, 11.

= 8.0.10 =

* Security fix: The logfile was prone to XSS attacks. Fixed.
* Added option 'Same as filmthumb' to the links on slideshow images.
This makes sense only for links on filmthubs to lightbox. This construction will transfer the click on slide image to filmstrip image.
This is to overcome the restriction that links from slideshow to lightbox do not support zoomable and panoramic images.
This will only work when the filmstrip is not disabled.
Note that zoomable and panoramic images on lightbox do not show name, description, rating etc below the image.
* Users without album admin rights are now also allowed to copy the 'admins choice' photos to their granted album;
i.e. for non album admin righted users, clicking My choice no longer returns an error when
Advanced settings -> System -> i -> Item 31: Admins choice action is set to To album or To album and zip.
* In the shortcode [wppa type="choice"], the attribute admin="" may contain a comma seperated list of users to display in the box.
This list used to be a list of display names, it now may also be a list of login names (or a mix), e.g.:
[wppa type="choice" admin="kimmy,opajaap"] (login names)
[wppa type="choice" admin="Kimmy,opajaap"] (mixed)
[wppa type="choice" admin="Kimmy,Opa Jaap"] (display names)
are all valid shortcodes.
Note 1: All names are case sensitive.
Note 2: This specification to limit the display does not exist in the widget implementation but you can put the shortcode in a text widget.
If you want to show your own zipfile only: Tick Advanced settings -> System -> I -> Item 30: Admins choice me only. This works on the widget also.
* When the 'Admins choice' selection includes tagging the photo, it will now be tagged by the users displayname rather than user-<userid>.
* Added maintenance procedure Advanced settings -> Maintenance -> III: One time conversions -> Item 3 to convert old style Choice generated tags to new style tags.
* Corrected (lowered) wheel zoom sensitivity on panoramic and zoomable images for browsers other than chrome.
* On new sites one did not have the rights to change the photo of the day settings. Fixed.

There are 3 options: 1. do not overrule, 2. always as possible and 3. never.

* Fixed a fatal error on the Album admin pages, that happened only when not admin and photo order restricted.
* Basic settings -> Misc -> I -> Item 3: Default coverphoto selection, has an extra checkbox named Fix first found. This shows only when a random methid is selected.
When checked, the first found will be registered as fixed cover image. The Reset all checkbox enables you to reset all the fixed coverimages.
* Dropped the selection item Compressed for pretty links as it often does not work correctly.
* Filmstrip layout was wrong when the size arg was used in the shortcode. Fixed.
* WPPA now uses wp-jquery-ui-dialog css file, and code has been changed to be compatible with it, to avoid conflicts with other plugins that use it also.

= 8.0.04 =

* Settings page will no longer crash when the php implementation does not support the exec() command.

* Extended alternate ajax methods and fixed certain links.
If frontend ajax links do not work, you can select different ajax methods on Advanced settings -> System -> I Item 5: Ajax method. ('Normal' is default).
Classic is like pre ver 8 method 'Ajax non admin' ticked, Backend method is like pre ver 8 'Ajax non admin' unticked (uses admin-ajax).
* If frontend upload does not work (give errors) set Advanced settings -> Users -> I Item 5.1: Upload Ajax method to 'extern' (like classic) or to 'backend' (uses admin-ajax). ('normal' is default).
* Note on upload. If you want users to upload to sites that have a site password, i.e. where users do not need to login with their name, treat them as non logged in.
To allow uploads in this case: tick the box in Advanced settings -> Users -> I Item 32: Upload logout, and make sure the owners of the albums allowed to upload to are set to ---public---.
* If you do not use the widget or the upload shortcode but let them upload using the album cover link, make sure empty albums are not skipped, to allow the first upload.
See Basic settings -> Albums -> II Item 7: Skip empty albums.
* Plugin All in One SEO tampers the internal wppa occurrance counters because it renders the page before the actual page building.
This results in certain links not working like the link from an image in a widget to a landing page, because the landing shortcode is no longer the first occurrance.
Provided a fix for this by resetting the counters at the end of the the process that builds the page header.
* When both defer javascript was active and the shortcode was cached, reponsiveness was no longer fully supported. Fixed.
* Switching off manual control on a spheric panorama caused a js error resulting in not displaying the image. Fixed.

= 8.0.02 =

* Further restructured javascript loading and inits. One can now also cache slideshows and slideshow widgets when defer javascript is on.
* Re-added the feature that non loggedin users can upload photos. Be careful wit this, especially make sure moderating is on.

Added an admin notice about this if applicable.
* Fixed frontend upload issues.
* Added option Advanced settings -> System -> I Item 5: Ajax method.
In vertsion 8 the official way to use Ajax at the frontend as documented in the Developers manual was implemented.
Unfortunately this method appears not to work on every site, so i added a selectionbox with 4 options.
If certain links at the frontend do not work, try one of the alternate methods.
If frontend upload does not work properly when the progressbar (i.e. ajax upload) is on,
try one of the alternate methods listed in Advanced settings -> Users -> I: Item 5.1: Upload Ajax method

= 8.0.01 =

* Re-added the WPPA+ text widget for backward compatibility.
* All querystring items now have a value. This fixes the fact that isset() returns false when the value is null, leading to certain links not working proprtly.
* Improved algorithm for lazy load on mobile devices.

= 8.0.00 =

* Restructured and greatly simplified settings page. Removed obsolete and redundant settings. Made the layout more friendly.
* Photo of the day admin page is now in the Settings page under Photos.
* To create albums or upload photos can only be done by logged in users, you can no longer configure these features for loggedout visitors.
* Custom css settings are being fased out. One is encouraged to move that to the wp customizer.
On the settings page you will only see the custom css items that are not empty. The help text encourages you to move the content to the wp customizer.
* Ajax method changed. No longer possible to choose between admin or non admin ajax.
Ajax is always activated, because there can no longer be conflicts due to inaccessibility of both ajax files from the frontend by http request.
* Photo count treshold has been removed because one can select a childrens image as cover image of any album.
* Nice scroller is no longer loaded on mobile devives. Scrollbars on mobile are nice enough by themselves and this improves performance.
* Removed WPPA+ Text widget. You can now use the WP Custom HTML widget instead.
* HTML in descriptions is now automatically allowed for those users who have HTML edit rights.
* Widgets do no longer show up anywhere if the corresponding feature is not enabled. e.g. Notify widget - Enable email. etc.
* The shortcode to display the most recently uploaded photo did not work when additionally the album was specified e.g.
[wppa type="photo" photo="#last,12"] or [wppa type="photo" album="12" photo="#last"]. Fixed. Works also for type="mphoto" and type="xphoto".
* Fixed a slideshow filmstrip layout issue for theme twentytwentyone.
* The max simultaneous ajax requests during resequencing photos is now limited to 10. This prevents db errors due to too many open db instances.
* Caching system is simplified. Just on or off. In widgets: checkbox; in shortcodes: '', '0', 'off' or 'no' means no caching; anything else means caching on.
Although the fact that there are separate cachefiles for logged-in and logged-out visitors, make sure you do not cache widgets or shortcodes that may display user dependant content.

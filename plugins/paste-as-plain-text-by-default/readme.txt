Enable paste as text by default with one click in editors like Classic Editor, Divi, Elementor, Beaver Builder and WPBakery. 

== Description ==

Enable paste as text by default with one click in editors like Classic Editor, Divi, Elementor, Beaver Builder, WPBakery and WPUF (but not in Gutenberg). 

No more unwanted formatting issues or junk code when copying and pasting text into your WordPress editor. Paste content from pdf documents, emails or other websites without importing colors and font stylings that don't match your overall design.

= Consistent Design =

No risk of importing mismatching colors, fonts or other styles when copying & pasting content.

= Clean Code =

Avoid unnecessary code on your website that could slow down your loading time and break the design.

= Fast Editing =

No need for custom hacks with keyboard shortcuts, cleaning your text in Notepad or repeatedly clicking the T icon.

= Compatibility =

This plugin supports the following page builders / editors:

- Classic Editor
- Divi Builder
- Elementor
- Beaver Builder

== Installation ==

The plugin is simple to install:

1. Download `paste-as-plain-text-by-default.zip`
1. Unzip
1. Upload the `paste-as-plain-text` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Go to the plugin management page and enable the plugin
1. That's it! There are no further settings needed.

You can find full details of installing a plugin on the [plugin page](https://divimundo.com/en/plugins/paste-as-plain-text/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I override the paste as text setting in a specific element? =

Sure, just click the Paste as text icon (T) in your editor to deactivate the setting for that specific element. However, the next time you edit the element, paste as plain text will be active again by default.

= Do I have to install the Classic Editor plugin? =

No, it will work with Divi Visual Builder, Elementor, Beaver Builder and WPBakery without using the Classic Editor plugin.

= Does it work with Gutenberg Block Editor? =

The plugin has no effect on the Gutenberg Block Editor but there are no known conflicts either. So if you use a page builder like Divi Builder on your pages and Gutenberg on your posts, you will have plain text by default on your pages but not on your posts.

= Could you add support for more page builders / editors? =

We have no plans to add support for Gutenberg but we could add support for other WordPress page builders and editors in the future. Feel free to send a feature request on the WordPress Plugin Support Page.

<span class="jd-tooltip-title">Type (Break Point)</span> [Optional]<br />
There are 2 types of break point, 'Idle' and 'Main Idle'. The default type is 'Idle'.<br />
Both will lead the animation idle for a specified period.
<br />
<br />
Multiple break points are allowed in the timeline of a slide. But only one break point can be type of 'Main Idle'. If there is no 'Main Idle' break point is specified, the first 'Idle' break point will be treated as 'Main Idle' break point.<br />
<br />
The only difference is that the 'Main Idle' will cowork with other functionalities. For example, if slider option 'Pause on Hover' is enabled, It will pause on the 'Main Idle' break point.

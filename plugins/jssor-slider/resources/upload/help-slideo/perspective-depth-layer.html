<span class="jd-tooltip-title">Depth (3D Space Perspective)</span> [Optional]<br />
Specifing <strong>Perspective Depth</strong> value, it will create a 3D space which is isolated from any other 3D space, otherwise it will inherit its parent container's 3D space if exists.<br />
<br />
For example, the value <strong>50%</strong> means the depth is 50% of 3D space size. Given a 3D space with size 400px x 400px, the perspective depth will be (400 + 400) / 2 * <strong>0.5</strong> = 200px.<br />
<br />
This option affects appearance of child layers applied with <strong>Rotate X</strong> or <strong>Rotate Y</strong> or <strong>Translate Z</strong> effect.

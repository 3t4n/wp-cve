<span class="jd-tooltip-title">Pointer Events</span> [Optional]<br />
Indicates a layer can become the target of mouse events. The value is 'all' by default which is interited from parent layer. <br />

<br />
<br />
The value 'none' instructs the mouse event to go "through" the layer and target whatever is "underneath" that layer instead.

<br />
<br />
For example, setting <strong>Pointer Events</strong> of a layer to 'none' can make a link layer (underneath this layer) clickable.

== Description ==
Simple Fancybox for WordPress image gallery. Works for both, shortcode gallery in classic editor and Gutenberg blocks. Install and activate, nothing else to set up here. Fancybox will work for WordPress galleries. Only important thing is to set link to file, we don’t want to open attachment page. By default, the plugin will use jQuery to apply FancyBox to any thumbnails that link directly to an image.

Fancybox includes support for touch gestures and even supports pinch gestures for zooming. It is perfectly suited for both mobile and desktop browsers. 

Fancybox has been tested in following browsers/devices:

* Chrome
* Firefox

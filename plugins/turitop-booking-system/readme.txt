TuriTop is an <a href="https://www.turitop.com" target=”_blank”> Online Booking </a> Software designed for tours, escape rooms and activity providers to manage their availabilities, centralize bookings and process online payments on their website.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a powerful real-time booking interface that blends in with your existing WordPress theme by connecting your TuriTop account to your WordPress site.

Your website visitors can check your availability and make a booking directly from your WordPress website at whatever time suits them. They can easily submit their details and make an online payment — all from a desktop or mobile device.

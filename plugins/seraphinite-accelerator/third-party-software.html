Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA</p><p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p><h4>Preamble</h4><p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General
Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</p><p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
you know you can do these things.</p><p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p><p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p><p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p><p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want
its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
reputations.</p><p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p><p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow.</p><h4>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h4><p>0. This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
licensee is addressed as "you".</p><p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only
if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
Program does.</p><p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p><p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.</p><p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p><p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p><p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
terms of this License.</p><p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p><p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them
as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p><p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is
to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
works based on the Program.</p><p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume
of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
scope of this License.</p><p>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based
on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p><p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and
so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
component itself accompanies the executable.</p><p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by
offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
along with the object code.</p><p>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p><p>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by
law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p><p>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p><p>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p><p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.</p><p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity
of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public
license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide
range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she
is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot impose that choice.</p><p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p><p>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
of this License.</p><p>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p><p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.</p><p>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into
other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software generally.</p><h4>NO WARRANTY</h4><p>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.</p><p>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.</p><h4>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4><h4>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h4><p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p><p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p><p>one line to give the
program's name and an idea of what it does.<br>

of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p><p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p><h4>0. Additional Definitions.</h4><p>As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the
GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the
GNU General Public License.</p><p>“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this
License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p><p>An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface
provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using
an interface provided by the Library.</p><p>A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking
an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with
which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.</p><p>The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means
the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p><p>The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work
means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any
data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p><h4>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</h4><p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p><h4>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</h4><p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an
Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:</p><p>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith
effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function
or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose
remains meaningful, or</p><p>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional
permissions of this License applicable to that copy.</p><h4>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</h4><p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate
material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such
object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines
in length), you do both of the following:</p><p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.</p><p>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and
this license document.</p><h4>4. Combined Works.</h4><p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice
that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions
of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:</p><p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.</p><p>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL
and this license document.</p><p>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices
during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these
notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL
and this license document.</p><p>d) Do one of the following:</p><p>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms
of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,
and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined
Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
Corresponding Source.</p><p>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of
the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible
with the Linked Version.</p><p>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU
GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and
execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or
relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,
you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)</p><h4>5. Combined Libraries.</h4><p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on
the Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and
convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of
the following:</p><p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
conveyed under the terms of this License.</p><p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part
of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p><h4>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</h4><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.</p><p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the
GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published
version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p><p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can
decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</p></body></html>

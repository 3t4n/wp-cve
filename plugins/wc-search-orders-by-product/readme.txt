A simple plugin that helps you search your WooCommerce orders by product.

== Description ==
WC Search Orders By Product does exactly what it says - This WooCommerce extension **automatically** adds product search, product type and product category filter dropdown in WooCommerce Orders screen. You can find orders by typing just a few characters of your product name. As you start typing in the search input, you will see instant results popping up inside the dropdown menu. The auto listing of the matching products with same characters inside the dropdown will help you in typo tolerance or if you misspell the product name.

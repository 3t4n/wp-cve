== Frequently Asked Questions ==
----------

**1. What is the difference between ACTIVE and CLOSED conversations?**

Not much actually, and really the difference is really up to you. When building the app we've grouped the chat messages to make your conversations by open or close to help make things more clear. However, you can close your conversation if you don’t want it to be on the top. You won't lose data by closing anything, and you will still get new messages. Active / Closed is just to simplify and optimize your conversations.


----------


**2. Types of attributes**

You can group, categorize things as you want. How you attribute things, is completely up to you. 

What kind of attributes can you send? Anything! Let us give you some examples:

- Company name
- Time spent on the page or in your shop
- Customer street
- Customer telephone number
- Birthday
- Sex
- Any other URLs


----------


**3. Does it support WooCommerce?**

Yes, You can chat throughout the signup or product detail pages!

When your customer adds product to cart or is checking out the order, he will send automatically an event containing product / order details.

I have purchased numerous other animals and aquarium equipment and had great experiences. The workers are helpful and very informative."
Dusty Berndt,"December 9, 2014",5,I have only been to Petland a few times due to the distance I live from there.  I have always had a good experience here.  My daughters love watching all the adorable puppies. I have entered our puppy Miley in the cutest puppy contest because has cute markings and a wonderful loving peronality and everyone seems to love her.  One of her favorite things to do is to cuddle.  She is a 5 month old pure breed American Bulldog.
Sheena Mohrbacher,"January 26, 2015",4,Workers are friendly and helpful. Answered any questions that my husband and i had. Animals seemed friendly and not secluded. We were not rushed out of the store after they closed.

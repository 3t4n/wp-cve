Display Product Images on Checkout Page.

== Description ==

If you are familiar with WooCommerce, then you know that The Order Review section of the WooCommerce Checkout Page shows the product name, quantity and subtotal,
But no product image, which can be very useful to identify/differentiate between similar products or product variations.
TP Show Product Images on Checkout does just that, the product featured image next to the product name inside the order review table. Easy and powerful!

**But Wait, There's More!**
In addition you can:
1. Show total discount on Cart/Checkout page.
2. Show Regular/Sale price on Cart/Checkout page.
3. Show total amount of money a customer saved (sale prices plus coupon discounts).

**And we forgot to mention, all for free!**
**So what are you waiting for? Download the plugin and enjoy.**

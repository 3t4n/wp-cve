== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which languages are supported? =

For all supported languages, please check [Translating WordPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/zip-recipes/)
If you need a new language, you can contribute there!

= Do you have a premium version? =

Yes, we do! The premium version has automatically generated nutritional info, ratings, automatic serving adjustment, search by ingredient and easily created recipe galleries. You can learn about our premium features here: [https://www.ziprecipes.net/premium](https://www.ziprecipes.net/)

= How do I edit a recipe with the Zip Recipes plugin? =

To edit or create a recipe, click the Zip Recipes icon on the visual editor toolbar, or in Gutenberg, type in "zip", then click the Zip Recipes icon. More info [here](https://ziprecipes.net/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-zip-recipes-plugin/).

= Can I use the plugin to add multiple recipes to one post or page? =

There should only be one recipe per post or page. The plugin does allow for compound recipes which is one way to include multiple lists of ingredients in your post. Under “creating a recipe” in the following article you can read how to do that.  [Click here to learn more](https://ziprecipes.net/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-zip-recipes-plugin/

= When I use Zip Recipe plugin where are the recipes stored? =

Your recipes are always stored on your own website. With Zip Recipes, your recipes are stored safely in a separate database table in your main WordPress database. The recipe table is named wp_amd_zlrecipe_recipes and you can take a look at it yourself using any WordPress database tools at your disposal.

= How about Intellectual Property? =

Your recipes are yours only! They're stored on your own server. Zip Recipes is only a tool to show your recipes on the internet.

= Why do you put a placeholder image into my Edit Post page, instead of my actual recipe? =

Because of the way WordPress' text editor works, if you decide to add or remove something from your recipe using the text editor, it can very easily mess up the markup of the code - so the Zip Recipe plugin prevents that from happening by not allowing you to edit the recipe in the text editor.

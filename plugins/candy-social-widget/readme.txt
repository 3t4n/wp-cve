== Description ==

Social Widget plugin for displaying links to your social media in any widget area. Created by [WPExplorer](https://www.wpexplorer.com/), this plugin allows you to add colorful icons with links to your social profiles of choice in any widgetized sidebar of your WordPress site. Choose from various social profiles (add only the ones you need), drag and drop to move them around, choose from square, round or rounded styles and even select your custom icon size.

The plugin uses SVG based icons so they don't require any extra font files and they will load quickly and display nicely on any screen, including retina devices.

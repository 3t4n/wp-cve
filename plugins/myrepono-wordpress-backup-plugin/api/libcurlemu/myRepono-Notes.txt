NOTES AND INFORMATION
=====================

The files and code included in this ZIP file are part of the CURL Extension Emulation Library (Version 1.0.4) which was developed by Steve Blinch (http://code.blitzaffe.com).

The CURL Extension Emulation Library is provided by myRepono.com for use with the myRepono Backup API, however the CURL Extension Emulation Library was not developed by myRepono (ionix Limited), nor have the files been modified in any way.  myRepono has prepared a custom ZIP file to distribute the CURL Extension Emulation Library, the only differences are the inclusion of this file, and the removal of the example.php which is normally included.

The CURL Extension Emulation Library is used as an Extension for the myRepono Backup API, when the CURL Extension Emulation Library is installed the myRepono Backup API will use the Emulation Library when making HTTP/HTTPS connections.  The CURL Extension Emulation Library is only used by the myRepono Backup API when preferred methods are not available - this extension will not be used unless all other options have failed.

The CURL Extension Emulation Library provides a pure-PHP implementation of the PHP CURL extension, for use on systems which do not already have the CURL extension installed.  It emulates all of the curl_* functions normally provided by the CURL extension itself.  The CURL Extension Emulation Library will automatically detect and use the best CURL implementation available on your server.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

1. Extract the files included in the myrepono-libcurlemu.zip ZIP file.

2. Create a directory called 'libcurlemu' in your myRepono API directory.  Your 'libcurlemu' directory should be in the same directory as your 'myrepono.php' API script, and your 'data' API data directory.

3. Upload all .php files included in the ZIP file to your 'libcurlemu' directory.

That's it, the myRepono API (and/or myRepono WordPress Backup Plugin) will automatically detect the CURL Extension Emulation Library and will load it if the API is unable to connect using a preferred method.

Extra advanced version of Genesis Featured Page Widget: Custom Content, Images, URLs etc. -- Only for (premium) Genesis Framework 2.0+!

== Description ==

> #### Increased Flexibility for Featured Pages with Genesis
> This plugin brings you a "Featured Page" widget with up to 34 options (instead of only 9)! Use it additionally to the existing original widget if you need more flexibility.
> 
> Especially useful for using own links and page teaser content on a home page or anywhere in a widget area. Fully leverages Genesis' awesomeness. Build with webmasters, non-coders and security in mind. I have developed this plugin for my clients to fullfill their needs for their home pages on their small business sites.
>
> **Control title link** for featured Page, plus Widget title link!
>
> **Set *custom* teaser content for page** - or use page excerpt, or content (limit) via Genesis :)
> 
> A great helper tool for Genesis Child Themes!

**Please note:** The plugin requires the *Genesis Theme Framework* (in version 2.0 or higher), a paid premium product released by StudioPress/ Copyblogger Media LLC (via studiopress.com).

Credit where credit is due: This plugin here is inspired and partly based on the work of the Genesis Developers for "Featured Page" widget, plus on the work of Johan van de Merwe for "Genesis Featured Page Extended" -- but can be used alongside both of them.

**Own translation/wording:** For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/genesis-featured-page-extras/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that, just use a language file like `genesis-featured-page-extras-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the tools on "Other Notes").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin replace the built-in "Featured Page" widget or third-party widgets? =
NO! It is fully optional and can be used side by side with original or other third-party widgets.

= Why another "Featured" (page) widget for Genesis? =
I needed more options for that page widget for myself for a long time, so I finally build/ forked it. If you're happy with the built-in widget or third-party widgets then it's absolutely fine to use them instead! :)

= How does the styling work? =
Same as before using this plugin. The widget from this plugin uses the same CSS classes as the original Genesis widget(s). The plugin does NOT touch any child theme styles. Still, it can be neccessary to style some of the *additionally* included selectors, for example if you're using one of the optional features.

This plugin does NOT enqueue any frontend or backend styles. It only provides a few additional CSS selectors in a few circumstances.

= Notes for Widget & Page Title Links =
* Widget title by default has no link to it, you can use the permalink of your selected page or your own URL, including the link target
* Page title by default is linked to its permalink (of selected page)
* Both titles can also be hidden if desired

= Notes for *More* Link =
The More link defaults to the used page's permalink -- or use your own URL, with optional link target setting

Note: link target setting is not available for the default page permalink as it cannot be tweaked in this kind of widget environment (not targetable)

= Note on Character Limits =
Character limits for Page Title and Content Teaser: only integer values are allowed, plus: cutoff is always after the full word not within it!

= Could I disable this plugin's Shortcode support for widgets? =
Of course, it's possible! Just add the following constant to your child theme's `functions.php` file or to a functionality plugin:
`
/** Genesis Featured Page Extras: Remove Widgets Shortcode Support */
add_filter( 'gfpe_filter_widget_shortcodes', '__return_false' );
`
Some webmasters could need this for security reasons regarding their stuff members or for whatever other reasons... :).

*Note:* Other plugins could still (independently from my plugin) enable shortcode support within (text) widgets or anywhere else.


**Final note:** I DON'T recommend to add customization code snippets to your child theme's `functions.php` file! **Please use a functionality plugin or an MU-plugin instead!** This way you can also use this better for Multisite environments. In general you are not abusing the functions.php for plugin-specific stuff and you are then also more independent from child theme changes etc. If you don't know how to create such a plugin yourself just use one of my recommended 'Code Snippets' plugins.

= How can I use the advantages of this plugin for multilingual sites? =
(1) In general: You may use it for "global" widgets.

(2) Usage with the "WPML" plugin:
Widgets can be translated with their "String Translation" component - this is much easier than adding complex footer credits logic for a lot of languages to your functions.php...

You can now also place the "Language Switcher Widget" at the bottom of your site :).

You can use the awesome ["Widget Logic"](http://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-logic/) plugin (or similar ones) and add additional paramaters, mostly conditional stuff like `is_home()` in conjunction with `is_language( 'de' )` etc. This way widget usage on a per-language basis is possible. Or you place in the WPML language codes like `ICL_LANGUAGE_CODE == 'de'` for German language. Fore more info on that see their blog post: http://wpml.org/2011/03/howto-display-different-widgets-per-language/

With the following language detection code you are now able to make conditional statements, in the same way other WordPress conditional functions work, like `is_single()`, `is_home()` etc.:
`
/**
 * WPML: Conditional Switching Languages
 *
 * @author David Decker - DECKERWEB
 * @link   http://twitter.com/deckerweb
 *
 * @global mixed $sitepress
 */
function is_language( $current_lang ) {

	global $sitepress;

	if ( $current_lang == $sitepress->get_current_language() ) {
		return true;
	}
}
`

*Note:* Be careful with the function name 'is_language' - this only works if there's no other function in your install with that name! If it's already taken (very rare case though), then just add a prefix like `my_custom_is_language()`.

--> You now can use conditionals like that:

`
if ( is_language( 'de' ) ) {
	// do something for German language...
} elseif ( is_language( 'es' ) ) {
	// do something for Spanish language...
}
`

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating I recommend the awesome ["Codestyling Localization" plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/) and for validating the ["Poedit Editor"](http://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, Mac and Linux.

== Idea Behind / Philosophy ==
As I needed more options for that page widget for myself for a long time, I finally build/ forked into my own new plugin. Sometimes it is really more helpful to have a few options handy then to rely only on decisions from someone...! ;-)

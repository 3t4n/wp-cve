== Description ==
Plugin Name: BbPress Notification<br>

I have a bbpress forum which have many users, I answer questions of my users. A problem is, in some days, when I check my forum, there are no user questions and in some other days if I did not check my forum,  I found users have question and not solved in these days, this is a trouble for me and my users.

Finally I decide to develope a bbpress plugin to solve the communication problem, when user have new topic or when user replied a topic, as a webmaster, I will receive mail notification, I can get topic title, content, URL,  Autohor, and reply content, reply URL, reply author links and I will get a link to submit my reply via a URL so if I am busy and have no time in PC, I can reply that link via in my mobile mail link directly, so my bbpress plugin bbpress noficication born.

<h4>How To Use:</h4>
bbPress Notification is a simple & quick & light bbpress notification solution, you do not need any setting in admin panel, it will detect all topic and 
reply and when new topic or new reply be published, you will get mail notification in your admin mailbox.

Of course,  it is customizable, based on a few reasones:
# My forum have many users which generate many content, so I donot want use my default bbpress admin email to receive these alerts
# Some users reported that they have multiple administrator, they hope all administrator can received new topic & reply notification via their own email addresses

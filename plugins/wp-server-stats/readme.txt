Monitor your WP site the right way with most important stats like Database, PHP details, PHP Memory, RAM Usage, CPU load, Server Uptime & more.

== Description ==

WP Server Health Stats plugin will give you the ability to monitor your WordPress site at its core level. With all-important server health stats like allocated PHP memory, memory usage, realtime RAM usage, CPU usage etc. you can always identify if something wrong is going on with your site.

Now you don't have to contact your host every single time for minor things. You can easily see the server health stats in your WP admin dashboard and make critical decisions based on that, like if enabling some plugin is consuming a lot of memory or CPU etc.

> It took many countless hours to code, design, test and include useful server info to show up in your WordPress dashboard. If you enjoy this plugin and understand the huge effort I put into this, please consider **[donating some amount](https://paypal.me/acnamhq) (no matter how small)** to keep alive the development of this plugin. Thank you again for using my plugin. If you love using this plugin, I would really appreciate it if you took 2 minutes out of your busy schedule to **[share your review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-server-stats/reviews/)** about this plugin.

=== Q: After installing this plugin my server load has increased tremendously. How to fix this? ===

 >This plugin uses Ajax to call the server after an interval of time to get the latest data about the server, giving you the real-time update. By default, this happens after every 200ms. But if you are using a low-end server with fewer resources, calling the server after each 200ms can increase your server load drastically. You can easily solve this too. On the left-hand side menu of WP Admin panel, you will see a settings panel for **WP Server Stats** under that you will find another sub-menu called **General Settings**. Within general settings, the first option is to change the interval time. Change it to how much higher your want like 2000ms (2 sec) or maybe 20000ms (20 sec) depending on your need. Once you save the settings the plugin will call the server only after the interval you have set, reducing your server load back to how it was without this plugin.
But again, generally speaking, if you are in a decent to good hosting, you won't face this problem at all, as this a very lightweight plugin.

Features of the plugin include:

* Purge WP Server Stats Cache (Which you can disable also. Check the FAQ section for more details.)
* Shows server OS
* Shows server software
* Shows the server IP address
* Shows server port
* Shows server location
* Shows server hostname

* If Memcached is enabled it will show you detailed information about your Memcached installation if provided appropriate Memcached host and port details in the **WP Server Stats** > **General Settings** page
* Shows total number of allowed CPU for your site
* Shows Real-Time CPU usage percentage
* Shows Total RAM allocated
* Shows Real-Time RAM Usage percentage

**READ BEFORE INSTALLING**

This plugin uses PHP `shell_exec()` function which is by default enabled by all good hosting companies. But a small percentage of hosting company disable `shell_exec()` by default. So, please contact your hosting company to make sure `shell_exec()` is enabled in your account before installing this plugin. Otherwise, you will get an ERROR Code `EXEC096T` for every feature that uses `shell_exec()`.

> **Now this plugin is also hosted in [Github](https://github.com/isaumya/wp-server-stats). But the Github repo will be used for the development of the plugin. So, from now on you can also report the bugs in [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/isaumya/wp-server-stats/issues) if you want.**

**Very Important Note**

This plugin has been developed and tested on Linux based servers only so there is a very high chance that it might NOT work for Windows-based servers. So, I highly recommend this plugin to be used by those users who use a Linux based server.
I currently have no plan to add Windows Server support as a very tiny amount of people still use Windows Server in this Linux age. I may add Windows support in future.

**ERROR Code List**

**EXEC096T** - PHP `shell_exec()` function has not been enabled in your account, which this plugin needs to run properly. Contact your server host and ask them to enable PHP `shell_exec()` function for your account.

**IP096T** - Your server is not returning the IP properly. There is definitely some issue with your server configuration. Please contact your host and tell them that PHP `gethostbyname( gethostname() )` is unable to get the server IP, ask them to look into their server configuration and to fix the configuration issue. If you have a self-hosted VPS or dedicated server, the reason is still the same. If you are unable to find the configuration issue inside your server, I highly suggest you hire a knowledgeable server admin to look into your server. In most cases, you should never get this error message.

**Languages**

WP Server Stats is 100% compatible with translation and you can translate any text to whatever language you want. As this plugin doesn't come with an inbuilt translation, I will suggest you to use a plugin like [Say What?](https://wordpress.org/plugins/say-what/) to change the text, you just have to use the text domain as `wp-server-stats` within the plugin to change the text.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need any special configuration in my server/hosting account? =

No. This plugin uses PHP `shell_exec()` function which is by default enabled by all good hosting companies. But a small percentage of hosting company disable `shell_exec()` by default. So, please contact your hosting company to make sure `shell_exec()` is enabled in your account before installing this plugin. Otherwise, you will get an ERROR Code `EXEC096T` for every feature that uses `shell_exec()`.

= How to Disable showing "Purge Cache - WP Server Stats" from the WP Admin Bar? =

If you want to disable showing "Purge Cache - WP Server Stats" from WP Admin Bar, simply open your `wp-config.php` file and just above all the database details mentioned, add the following line:
`define('WPSERVERSTATS_ADMINBAR_DISABLE', true);`
That's it. Save your `wp-config.php` file, go back to your WordPress Dashboard and you will see that the WP Server Stats Purge Cache option is now gone.
If you are still seeing that option, please clear all kind of cache you have on your website. Enjoy the update. Thanks to [@djquadrocks](https://profiles.wordpress.org/djquadrocks/) for the idea.

= What are the different ERROR Codes thrown by this plugin? =

**ERROR Code List**

**EXEC096T** - PHP `shell_exec()` function has not been enabled in your account, which this plugin highly needs to run properly. So contact your server host and ask them to enable PHP `shell_exec()` function for your account.

**IP096T** - Your server is not returning the IP properly. There is definitely some issue with your server configuration. Please contact your host and tell then that PHP `gethostbyname( gethostname() )` is unable to get the server IP, ask them to look into their server configuration and to fix the configuration issue. If you have a self-hosted VPS or dedicated server, the reason is still the same. If you are unable to find the configuration issue inside your server, I highly suggest you hire a knowledgeable server admin to look into your server. In most cases, you should never get this error message.

= 1.6.4, April 14, 2018 =

* Rolling back to using `MemFree` instead of going to look for `MemAvailable` value despite you have that available in your server or not. As per the [issue posted here](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/ram-unknown-negative-value/) - it is no longer possible to trust the `MemAvailable` parameter value as it could be higher than `MemTotal` and hence breaking the entire Real-time RAM checking feature.

= 1.6.3, April 6, 2018 =

* If your current server environment provides the support for `MemAvailable` in the `/proc/meminfo` file then the plugin will take that data for a more accurate measure of RAM available, otherwise it will take the `MemFree` value.

= 1.6.2, April 6, 2018 =

* As it turns out `MemAvailable` is not available for all the servers. It is only available in some distros like Ubuntu. That is why I'm again falling it back to `MemFree` as that is widely available across all systems and distros and will work flawlessly with all server.

= 1.6.1, April 5, 2018 =

* Started using `MemAvailable` instead of `MemFree` in the program to accurately know the availability of free RAM on the server. Special thanks to [@inspired888](https://profiles.wordpress.org/inspired888) for reporting the issue.

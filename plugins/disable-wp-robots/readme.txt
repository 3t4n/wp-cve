Activate this plugin to disable the robots meta tag that was added in WP v5.7.



== Description ==

> Does one thing: disables WP robots meta tag.

Activate this plugin to disable the robots meta tag (added in WP version 5.7).


**Features**

* Lightweight - only one line of code.
* Simple to use - activate and done.
* No settings to worry about.
* Easy peasy.


**Why is this useful?**

Because most existing WordPress sites (i.e., a LOT of sites) already have robots meta tags taken care of, either via plugin or theme enhancements. So when upgrading to WordPress 5.7, there may be conflicting or redundant meta tags, which may not be optimal for SEO. This simple plugin disables the new WP robots meta tag completely, so it will not interfere with existing meta robots configurations. Or maybe you are setting up a new site and don't want WordPress to add any meta tags to your pages. Whatever the reason, this plugin will do the job with a click.

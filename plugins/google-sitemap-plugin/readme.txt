== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the Sitemap plugin work? =

Sitemap plugin generates the "sitemap.xml" file, which is located in the website root directory. You can add this file to your Google Tools account.
The plugin cannot apply any visual changes to your website.

= How to create sitemap.xml file? =

After opening the Settings page the sitemap.xml file will be created automatically in the site root.

= Cannot create "sitemap.xml" file (not updating in the "robots.txt" file) =

Check the plugin version and the folder permissions (it is better to use 644 or 755). You should create both files manually ("robots.txt" and "sitemap.xml") and set permissions to 755 for both.

= I have enabled 'Robots.txt' option, but sitemap path hasn't been added to the 'robots.txt' file. The file is the same for any site of a multisite network. Is it normal? =

You should edit '.htaccess' file which is located in the root of your WordPress installation. Please open it with a text editor and add the following code to the end of this file:

`&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule robots\.txt$ index.php?gglstmp_robots=1
&lt;/IfModule&gt;`

Also, "Search Engine Visibility" option should be unmarked on the Settings &gt; Reading page.

= I have a large number of posts and sitemap file isn't created =

Try to increase an available memory limit (i.e. up to 256M) by adding the following lines to your 'wp-config.php' file:

`ini_set('memory_limit','256M');
define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');`

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =

Please make sure that the problem hasn't been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem's description:

- The link to the page where the problem occurs
- The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version - your order number.
- The version of your WordPress installation
- Copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wi2X8RdRGXk9kMszQy1xItJrpN0ncXgioH935MaBKtc/)

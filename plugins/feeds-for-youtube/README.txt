### Performance Optimized
While other YouTube plugins load a low-performing iframe when your page loads to show YouTube videos, Feeds for YouTube uses the YouTube API to retrieve and display your videos. This means your YouTube videos are loaded lightning fast and won't slow down your visitor's experience with your website. But we don't stop there. Our YouTube plugin also waits until a site visitor interacts with your YouTube feed before adding the video player to the page. This results in visitors loving your site and encouraging them to stick around longer.

= Setting up the plugin =

The Feeds for YouTube plugin is brand new and so we're currently working on improving our documentation for it. If you have an issue or question please submit a support ticket and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

1) Once you've installed the "Feeds for YouTube" plugin click on the "Feeds for YouTube" item in your WordPress menu

2) Click on the large blue YouTube login button to get your Access Token and Refresh Token. Note; if you have your own Developer Project set up then you can enter your API key by enabling the checkbox below the YouTube login button.

3) Authorize the plugin to read data about your videos and channel.

4) YouTube sends back your Access Token and Refresh Token which are then automatically saved by the plugin. This information is required in order to connect to the API.

5) Enter a channel name to display videos from.

6) Continue to the feed customizer page to customize your feed.

7) Once you've customized your feed, embed it using the "Embed" button found at the top of the customizer.

8) Alternatively, copy the [youtube-feed feed=1] shortcode and paste it into any page, post or widget where you want the YouTube feed to appear.

9) You can use the default WordPress 'Text' widget to display your feed in a sidebar or other widget area.

11) View your website to see your feed(s) in all their glory!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display multiple YouTube feeds on my site or on the same page? =

Yep. You can display multiple feeds by creating them with the customizer and adding the feed ID to a shortcode.

= How do I embed a YouTube gallery directly into a WordPress page template? =

You can embed a gallery directly into a template file by using the WordPress [do_shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) function: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[youtube-feed feed=1]'); ?>`.

= Will the plugin work with W3 Total Cache or other caching plugins? =

The Feeds for YouTube plugin should work in compatibility with most, if not all, caching plugins, but you may need to tweak the settings in order to allow the feed to update successfully and display your latest posts.  If you are experiencing problems with your feed not updating then try disabling either 'Page Caching' or 'Object Caching' in W3 Total Cache (or any other similar caching plugin) to see whether that fixes the problem and the feed displays and updates successfully.

= Can I change whether the video autoplays or plays on click =

Yep, just use the following setting: Feeds for YouTube > Customize > Video Experience > When does video play? You can then set the video to play when clicked or to autoplay.

= How can I change the layout of my feed? =

This free plugin has several layout options built into it. Use the settings in the following location to display your videos in a list, grid, or gallery layout: Feeds for YouTube > Customize > Layout.  You can also change the spacing/padding between the videos by using the "Spacing between videos" setting in this same section.

= Can I select how many YouTube videos should be displayed in the feed? =

Yep, you can choose to display between 1-50 videos in your feed by using the following setting: Feeds for YouTube > Customize > Layout > Number of Videos. The plugin also contains a "Load More" button to allow you to infinitely load more videos into your feed.

= Will my YouTube gallery be responsive to accommodate mobile visitors? =

Yes. All feed layouts are completely mobile responsive. Using the plugin's gallery layout will automatically scroll visitors to the video player to view the video when the video thumbnail is clicked.

= Will videos from my YouTube channel be cached? =

Yes. The plugin will cache all of the posts collected from the API. Your YouTube videos and information about your channel can then be retrieved and used for future page loads.

= How do I find the YouTube nickname or channel ID for different YouTube channels? =

You can display videos from any YouTube channel using the unique YouTube channel ID. This can be found by viewing the channel page on YouTube and looking at the end of the URL. ex: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1a2b3c4D5F6g7i8j9k. You can also use the channel nickname or enter the YouTube handle when creating a feed.

= Will displaying my YouTube channel affect the time it takes to load the page? =

The plugin has a few features to minimize the impact it has on page load time. For example, iframes for playing YouTube videos are not loaded until the feed is interacted with by a visitor. Thumbnails of your YouTube videos are the smallest resolution necessary relative to the size of the feed. Also, these video thumbnails are not loaded until the rest of the content on the page is loaded.

= How often do new videos from my channel appear in the feed? =

By default, the plugin retrieves new videos for your YouTube gallery once every hour. You can reduce this to as little as 15 minutes if needed. You can even set your feed to update using WordPress cron in the background so the caching process is not relying on the page with your YouTube feed being visited.

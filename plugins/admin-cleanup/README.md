# Admin Cleanup
This plugin helps you organize your WordPress admin menu.

#### Why?

If your site has a bunch of custom post types, or many plugins with their own top-level menu, then the WP admin menu will quickly become overcrowded.

This plugin lets you hide menu items (e.g. `Tools`) entirely, or move them into the WP Admin Bar.

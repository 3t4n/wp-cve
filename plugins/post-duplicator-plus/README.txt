Duplicate a post or page with one click. Simple plugin. Just a few lines of code. 

== Description ==

The plugin does only one job - add a button 'Duplicate' in the post and the page list. We intentionally kept it simple and minimal. If you are looking for a feature rich plugin, there are other options.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What options are available? =

The plugin only adds a 'duplicate' button in the post and page list. 

= What is duplicated by default? =

With all default options, taxonomies and postmeta. 

= Is it possible to adjust anything? =

The post or page will be copied with default options. If you need to adjust parameters, you can check other feature rich plugins. We are not competing with them. Our goal is to give you a simple duplicate button with few lines of code.

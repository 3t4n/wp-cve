== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin zip file. Extract and upload simple-link-directory in your wp-content/plugins folder.
2. From the wp-admin panel go to plugins and activate the plugin
3. Create a new page and paste the plugin Short Code with short code generator. 
5. You are done.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I cannot save my Directory List. delete item or add new items to the List =
The issue you are having with saving the Diretory Lists is because of a limitation set in your server. Your server probably has a low limit for how many form fields it will process at a time. So, after you have added a certain number of links, the server refuses to save new link items. The server’s configuration that dictates this is max_input_vars. Set it to a high limit like max_input_vars = 10000. You can do it with local php.ini file or htaccess if your server supports it, Otherwise, please contact your hosting company support if needed.


= The sub title is not showing =
The default template does not show subtitles. Use style-1 from the shortcode generator to display subtitles. To show sub titles on the default template as tool tip, please upgrade to the Simple Link Directory Pro version.

= Does the free version have filter buttons? =
No. It is a pro version feature at the moment. But in the future, we have plans to make it available in the free version as well.

= I cannot have more than 1 columns =
To display more than one column, you need to create multiple Lists and choose to Show All Lists from the shortcode generator. A single list will always show in a single column.

= I’m having trouble grasping the use of categories. It seems like and that they can only be assigned to a list rather than a specific link. =
The base pillars of SLD are Lists, not individual links. The most common use case scenario of SLD is to create and display multiple Lists of many Links on specific topics. As such, there is no option for a Link (list item) to belong to multiple Lists or Categories. That would make the process of creating Lists slower. For each link you would have to select a List and a Category from drop downs despite the chances of a single List item to belong to multiple Lists are usually not that high. When you have dozens or hundreds of Lists that would become a real issue to create or manage your Lists.

= Do you have pagination or load more items? I have thousands of links=
Items in lists can be paginated in the pro version. This option is available in the shortcode generator. But you can also add the parameters manually.

Values: “true”, “false”. This option will allow you to paginate list items. It will break the list page wise.
Example: paginate_items=“true”. You also need to add the parameter per_page. This option indicates the number of items per page. Default is “5”. paginate_items=“true” is required to get this parameter working.
Example: per_page=“5”

Lists themselves cannot be paginated as the main concept of SLD is to be a Simple, One Page Directory.


= I have a list to import but it does not work and there is no message saying why my import does not work. =
The most common reason for failed import is encoding. The CSV file itself and characters in it must be in utf-8 format. Please check your CSV file for any unusual/non-utf-8 characters. If the problem persists, please email us the CSV file.


= I have some blank page that are crawled by Google! How to avoid them? =

Like many, if not most, WordPress plugins SLD uses custom posts and WordPress creates slug URLs even though they are not being used by SLD at the moment. We are working on making use of them.

But rest assured they are not harmful. They are generally not linked from anywhere and not indexed by Google. The only exception is if you have an XML sitemap generator that automatically scans and generates Links to these slug URLs. Yoast SEO plugin does that. You can exclude those slugs from xml sitemap. Go to Yoast->XML Sitemap->Post Types tag and select Manage List Items (sld) to Not in sitemap – then Save.


= How can I upgrade from free version of SLD to Pro version? =
1. Download the latest pro version of the plugin from website
2. Log in to your WordPress admin area and go to the Plugins management page.
3. Deactivate and Delete the old version of the plugin (don’t worry – your data is safe)
4. Upload and Activate the latest pro version of the plugin
5. You are done.


= I have setup List Categories and Lists and neither is showing on home page. Did I install correctly? =
You have to put the short code on the WordPress oage or post page where you want to show the List/s. There is a Shortcode generator in your page or post visual editor. Use that to create shortcode and insert to your page, where you want to display the lists, easily.

= Is SLD mobile friendly? Does it function well on cells and tablets? =
Yes, all templates are mobile device friendly and Responsive.

= How Can I Translate Your Plugin or Use Another Language Besides English? =
You can change the language texts from the Settings area. Currently, multi language is not supported.


== Use ==

1. Create new lists with your links.
2. After activating the plugin, create a new page or post. In the body section write this shortcode 
[qcopd-directory mode="all" column="3" style="style-1" ]
3. Save the page/post and check the page in front end. You'll see a nicely designed Link Directory.
4. Under the SLD Settings-Help in admin area you can find more details and tips.

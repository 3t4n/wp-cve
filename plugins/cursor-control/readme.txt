== Frequently asked questions ==

= Why doesn't this work with Internet Explorer? =

The idea of this plugin is to make a user friendly, easy way for you to be able to upload custom cursor image via the WordPress admin and easily add it to your site. IE requires you to use .cur image files for cursor icons. These files cannot be uploaded via the built-in WordPress media uploader.

= What will Internet Explorer users see instead of my custom cursor image? =

They will see the default cursor.

= Can I use an animated gif as my cursor image? =

At this time, no browsers support animated cursors.

= What are the image size restrictions? =

Maximum cursor dimensions are 128 x 128 pixels. Smaller images (32 x 32, 64 x 64) are recommended.

= What image file types can be used? =

You can upload png, jpg, and gif files.

By default it randomly pulls from a list of several replacement words and phrases such as "Hello", "Welcome", and "Get to the choppa". The plugin also comes with a menu where you can limit it to professional sounding greetings, set a static word or phrase, or add your own list (which can be by itself or added into the default list for even more variety)!= List of replacement words/phrases =Professional greetings, also part of the default list* Chow,* Hello,* Aloha,* Bonjour,* Welcome,* Greetings,* Konnichiwa,Default list* Get to the choppa,* Live long and prosper,* We require a shrubbery,* May the force be with you,* Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,* Wassap,* Don't mind me,* Looking good today,* Eat all your vegetables,* I can see you right now,* I can hear you breathing,* Have you showered recently,* There is a ninja behind you,* Do you know what time it is,* Wipe that grin off your face,* Don't make me come down there,* You just gained +5 WordPress skills,* I know you are sitting at a computer,* Did you remember to brush your teeth,* Did you put on clean underwear this morning,* Don't read this directly or you will get a lazy eye,= A word on support and additional features =Due to time constraints, I am not able to keep up with this plugin as much as I would like.

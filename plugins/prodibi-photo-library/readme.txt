Prodibi images are more secure than normal images by nature because only the parts and resolution needed is streamed to the viewer.
The original image is never sent. Your HD file is stored on our secured server that only you can access, and right click is disabled.

Url and images encryption will make it difficult for an attacker to automate the download of parts.
Stealth mode makes images invisible when an attacker tries to get them from a debugger.

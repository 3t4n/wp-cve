**What&#39;s in it**
The Image Optimizer resizes images, compresses, and optimizes images in formats, including PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP, and PDF, while preserving the high quality of your images.

**Three modes of compression**
To ensure the best image compression and resizing of images, the 10Web image compressor offers 3 modes of compression. The modes include conservative, balanced, and extreme.

**Resize image**
Resize images to save space and speed up your site. The 10Web image compression plugin allows resizing of image files by up to 80%, depending on the image and compression type.

**WebP compression**
WebP compression is used by Image Optimizer to generate images that are smaller in size than those created by JPEG and PNG. As a result, WebP enables faster page loads while maintaining image quality.

The size and number of resized images are also reported. Through this function, you can stay informed of your website’s image optimization status, including when the last optimization occurred and how much space you’ve saved as a result.

Easily create wishlists for your wedding, birthday or other occasion.

== Description ==

Are you looking for a clean and simple solution to display your wedding gift registry on your website or just want to create a wishlist for your birthday or other occasions?
WPGiftRegistry easily lets you add gifts to your wishlist and embed it anywhere with a shortcode. Each gift is displayed with an image, a title, a description, the price and a product link. More importantly, people can indicate if they already bought the gift (so nobody else does).

WPGiftRegistry comes with a nice design and is built responsively so it displays nicely on all devices.

= Languages =
* English

*Disclaimer*: As this is a free plugin, some of your product links may be transformed into affiliate links.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wpgiftregistry` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create wishlists through the new backend menu titled "Wishlists"
4. Place your shortcode (e.g. `[wishlist id='49']`) anywhere in your content, to display the wishlist

If you want to display a list with links to each of your wishlists, use the shortcode `[wishlist id='all']`.

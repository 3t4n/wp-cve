Greatly Improve Performance by Disabling All Unnecessary Features. All with this One lightweight plugin.

== Description ==

Do you know what is better for a website performance then installing a good caching plugin and getting more expensive hosting?

== Not to load bloat in the first place! ==

This lightweight plugin is meant to do just that.

With this All-in-One plugin you can simply disable any feature that you do not use with one click.

If you change your mind and want feature back you can always re-enable it later.

You can also chose any combo of features that you do not want and make a custom selection for disabling.


== Disable All of the Comments ==

*(PRO version only)*

If you are sick of SPAM or you do not need Comment Section so much then Disable them Completely with this one lightweight plugin.


== Having Too Many Plugins Can Hurt Your Website ==

* Installing and activating numerous plugins on your website can affect your page load time and the performance of your site as a whole. 

* Plugin conflicts can result in slow-loading pages, error messages, or broken functionality. Ultimately, a plugin conflict can cause a website to crash.

* Security risks. The more plugins you install, the greater the risk that you’ll download one with a security vulnerability.

* Learning curves. Each plugin’s dashboard or settings interface is different and the time required to learn how to take advantage of each plugin quickly adds up. Plus, there’s often maintenance involved to ensure that each one functions properly.


== With this All-in-One plugin you can forget installation of one plugin for each feature that you want to disable. ==

There are simply way too many of those in WordPress and you really do not want to have bunch of plugins hogging server resources just for that.

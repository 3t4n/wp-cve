**The result is a powerful marketing tool that will allow you to:**

**IDENTIFY MOST FREQUENTLY ADDED PRODUCTS**

- Discover the most popular products added to all wishlists created by users in your store
- Find out how many users have added a specific item to how many wishlists
- View stock information of each product added to the wish list in case you decide to change its price.

**TRACK WISHLIST CONTENT**

- Have insight into your customers' wishlists
- Preview the number of products included in a specific wishlist
- Find out when each wishlist was created
- Easily figure out when each wishlist holder has received the last promotional email

**CREATE PROMOTIONAL EMAILS**

- Create and send promotional emails
- Remind customers who added items to their wishlist but never purchased them by comparing this report with your orders data. A discount might also be a good idea.

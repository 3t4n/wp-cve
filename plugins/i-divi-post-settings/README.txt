The plugin add some fields in Divi Theme Customizer for setting your favorite default post, page and project settings. Once you have set them when you create a new post you got the Divi Settings metabox already set with the values you chose.

== Description ==

Once you activate the plugin you will see four new sections called 'Divi Post Settings', 'Divi Page Settings', 'Divi Project Settings' and 'Divi Product Settings' under the Blog panel in the Divi Theme Customizer. From here you can set your default values for Divi Settings.

Once saved, every time you will create a new post, page or project you'll have these Divi Settings already set. No more frequent changes required every time you write a new post!

Yes, of course. You can always change manually the Divi Settings from inside posts/pages/products/projects; however when hit 'Add New' button the settings you chose in the Customizer will be applied as the default ones.

IdeaPush is a feature request management system for WordPress 

== Description ==

With IdeaPush you can add an awesome feature/idea request system to WordPress. Use IdeaPush to generate new ideas or get feedback from actual users and customers or use it as a support triage system or use it for something else!

Watch the plugin walkthrough:

Check out the [demo page here](https://northernbeacheswebsites.com.au/ideapush-feature-requests/) and submit an idea for the plugin.

= Rich and extensive notifications =
Easily activate automatic notifications for the administrator, idea authors or voters for a range of actions. Use our simple but powerful shortcode generator to make your email subject and content dynamic, relevant and personalised.

= Intelligent voting =
Enable users or guests to vote on ideas with an up vote only or an up and down vote so poor ideas can be buried and good ideas can rise. Place a daily maximum voting limit on voting to prevent misuse. Set a vote threshold for your board so ideas automatically change status when the vote goal is reached.

= Fast idea creation =
With an accessible form users or guests can create new ideas and assign ideas tags and an attachment. Like votes, new ideas can have a daily limit so things don't get out of control. Eliminate bot ideas with built-in honeypot and math problem protection. When new ideas are submitted, ideas can either be automatically published or get assigned a pending status for administrator approval. Upgrade to pro to show suggested ideas to users whilst they write a new idea to prevent duplication. 

= Easy to use and fast setup =
The admin interface is well organised and provides extensive options for customising the plugin. Create a new board in seconds and add the board shortcode provided to any post or page. 

= Statuses to keep things organised =
Statuses keep your ideas organised and logical within a typical development workflow. Ideas when created are set to open and are set to reviewed when the vote goal has been reached and can then be changed to approved or declined and then to in progress and completed. Ideas can be edited in the backend like any other WordPress post. Optionally, tags can be used as a secondary categorisation method to better manage ideas.

= Beautiful, dynamic and intuitive user interface =
Great attention to detail has been made to bring the frontend design to a professional level. IdeaPush is a dynamic Ajax powered interface so ideas move up and down as a vote gets cast. When ideas are sorted to show ideas by the most popular, recent, trending, your own ideas or ideas you have voted on, new ideas are fetched. Ideas can also be filtered by status or tags to create specific lookups of ideas. 

Or better yet, use our super powerful live search filter to search idea titles, content, authors and tags with search phrase highlighting.

Each idea has its own page for sharing and SEO purposes and for administrators there are quick action buttons on the single idea page to bring idea triage to the frontend. Upgrade to pro to remove the single idea page. 

= Other things =
* The plugin tightly integrates with existing WordPress functions
* Translate certain things in the plugin settings and translate the rest using Poedit - German has already been done!
* Extension board and global options
* Enable or disable comments for ideas
* An array of action hooks for other developers to sink their teeth into
* You can choose to make a board available only to a certain user role or hide a board from WordPress search
* It's mobile responsive

= Upgrade to pro =
Upgrade to pro to unlock multiple boards and our powerful idea suggestion system to minimise duplicate ideas and so much more!

* We have now implemented our own custom font called IdeaPush on the frontend instead of using Font Awesome 4.7. The benefit of this is that if you are using Font Awesome 5 or above you will no longer have a clash with IdeaPush as this issue was becoming more and more common. Also it provides us with more flexibility in the future to manipulate icons however we want to rather then being stuck with a standard font library. So icons will look a little bit different now, but hopefully you like the change! On paper this version 6 may seem little but it has required a lot of effort and because a lot of people have made customisations to icons I wanted to make this a major release just as a signal that you might need to tweak things after updating if you have made customisations.

Also it provides us with more flexibility in the future to manipulate icons however we want to rather then being stuck with a standard font library. So icons will look a little bit different now, but hopefully you like the change! On paper this version 6 may seem little but it has required a lot of effort and because a lot of people have made customisations to icons I wanted to make this a major release just as a signal that you might need to tweak things after updating if you have made customisations.

"When someone creates an idea and isn't logged in, IdeaPush creates a user "

"important we do this because it prevents people gaming the voting. Because "
"otherwise a guest could create 50 different guest accounts and vote up their "
"idea 50 times! \n"
"\n"
"The downside of this though is that if you have enabled guest voting and "
"then someone who has already created a vote goes to a computer with a "
"different IP address and tries to create an idea with the same email they "
"won't be able to create a new idea as the email has already been associated "
"to another IP address.\n"
"\n"
"If this doesn't work for you, have no fear, because we can get around this "
"by just using the built-in WordPress user registration system. So firstly in "
"the board settings in the plugin settings you want to turn: GUEST VOTES/"
"IDEAS to No. This will prevent guests creating ideas. Now you need to "
"provide an outlet for users to create an account on your site - this can be "
"done in many many different ways, it depends on what works for you. But you "
"could have some text like, \"What to create an idea, click here to create an "

"At this point in time we don't provide a coded solution to achieve this "

"When users vote or create an idea they are given a role of \"IdeaPush Guest"

"created as WordPress requires posts to be assigned to an author, so when "
"idea \"posts\" are created we need to create a WordPress user for them so we "
"can assign the post to the user. Also by creating a WordPress user it means "
"the user can log in and and out of your site to maintain their IdeaPush "
"history. The other role we provide \"IdeaPush Manager\" is a role which you "
"can manually assign to a user which enables them to create/edit/delete ideas "
"from the backend and also change the IdeaPush settings but it gives them no "

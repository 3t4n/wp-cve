"The downside of this though is that if you have enabled guest voting and "

"If this doesn't work for you, have no fear, because we can get around this "

"the board settings in the plugin settings you want to turn: GUEST VOTES/"
"IDEAS to No. This will prevent guests creating ideas. Now you need to "

"When users vote or create an idea they are given a role of \"IdeaPush Guest"
"\" which is basically a role of no importance or capability. This role is "
"created as WordPress requires posts to be assigned to an author, so when "
"idea \"posts\" are created we need to create a WordPress user for them so we "
"can assign the post to the user. Also by creating a WordPress user it means "
"the user can log in and and out of your site to maintain their IdeaPush "
"history. The other role we provide \"IdeaPush Manager\" is a role which you "
"can manually assign to a user which enables them to create/edit/delete ideas "
"from the backend and also change the IdeaPush settings but it gives them no "
"other permissions. Note: IdeaPush Manager's don't have the ability to access "

"The plugin uses the standard WordPress comment system, so the display of "

"submit comments on new posts\". 2) Some themes disable comments or have an "
"option to enable/disable comments, so make comments are enabled for single "
"posts. 3) If you have any custom code or plugins mucking around with "
"comments perhaps try turning this off for now. 4) It's important in your "
"theme that the single.php file has the comments_template(); tag called. You "
"can also create a custom template file for ideapush called single-idea.php "
"and include the comment tag in there. See this article <a href=\"https://"

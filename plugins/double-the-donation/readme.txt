== Description ==

Double the Donation is the leading provider of matching gift software solutions to nonprofit and educational institutions. 360MatchPro by Double the Donation increases revenue from corporate matching gifts while saving staff time. This plugin provides a shortcode that allows you to easily embed the 360MatchPro plugin into your website on a dedicated matching gift page.

### About Our Plugin:

After getting set-up with your 360MatchPro account and donation form integration, create a dedicated matching gift page on your website to provide your donors with the forms, guidelines, and instructions they need to submit matching gift and volunteer grant requests.

Our plugin seamlessly integrates with your WordPress website to instantly connect donors to matching gift and volunteer grant information. [On a dedicated matching gift page](https://support.doublethedonation.com/portal/en/kb/articles/creating-a-dedicated-matching-gift-page), you can explain what matching gift programs are and provide donors with a chance to look up their employer's program forms, guidelines, and instructions. Provide answers to frequently asked questions and your dedicated matching gift page will become a useful resource to include in emails, newsletters, and direct messages.

Our WordPress plugin is serviceware, meaning a paid subscription to 360MatchPro by Double the Donation will be necessary to use our plugin. To find out more about our service, sign up, or get a demo, [visit our website here](https://doublethedonation.com/).

= I don't have a Double the Donation 360MatchPro account. How can I get one?

Visit [https://doublethedonation.com](https://doublethedonation.com) to explore Double the Donation's service and sign up or get a demo.

= Can we add Double the Donation's plugin into multiple locations on our website?

Yes many organizations use Double the Donation's plugin in multiple spots including on a dedicated matching gift page, on a ways-to-give page, and somewhere in the donation process. Additionally you'll want to [activate an integration](https://doublethedonation.com/integrations/) with a donation form partner so donors are provided with the matching gift information they need in the donation process.

= Is Double the Donation's Wordpress Plugin a donation tool?

No, Double the Donation's matching gift plugin is not a donation tool. This plugin allows users who have a 360MatchPro subscription with Double the Donation to put the full search tool on a Wordpress page. Most of the time organizations are using the Double the Donation Wordpress Plugin to put Double the Donation's search tool on a dedicated matching gift page. Additionally, most organizations use a separate donation tool, many of which have integrations with 360MatchPro, so the matching gift information needed by donors is available during the donation process itself.

= What's the difference between this Double the Donation Plugin and the “Give - Double the Donation” Plugin?

This Double the Donation Plugin should be used by every organization that uses Wordpress, has an active 360MatchPro subscription or Legacy Plan subscription with Double the Donation, and wants to add Double the Donation's full matching gift plugin onto a dedicated matching gift page or elsewhere on your website. The "Give - Double the Donation Plugin" is an add-on to GiveWP's donation form which allows nonprofit users of GiveWP to integrate Double the Donation's 360MatchPro into your organization's GiveWP donation form.

= How does Double the Donation identify which companies offer matching gift programs and maintain its database?

Double the Donation maintains the largest, most comprehensive, and most accurate matching gift database. We know size matters because we are in the business of helping donors submit their matching gift requests. Our database of matching gift companies covers more than 26 million employees, estimated to have 99.68% coverage of all matching eligible donors.

Your donors will search for subsidiaries, brand names, and local offices. They will misspell company names. The comprehensive nature of the Double the Donation database ensures that no matter what your donors search, they find the right company.

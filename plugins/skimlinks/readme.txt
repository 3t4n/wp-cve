Because of our scale we can negotiate the very best commissions for our publishers, which means you can earn up to 110% of what you would have earned if you managed your affiliate links program yourself.

Skimlinks lets the normal link appear, and turns it into an affiliate link only when the user clicks through, so there is no visible difference to the user. This gives users more trust in your site, and increases the likelihood they will click on the link.

The Skimlinks technology is monitored 24/7, and is fully redundant. If, in the unlikely event, our technology stops working, links will not be affiliated for a temporary period but the user experience is not affected.

The CFF plugin allows you to create both simple and professional forms. Its form builder includes dynamic calculated fields and many other controls.

== Description ==

Absolutely! The "Calculated Fields Form" plugin opens up a world of possibilities. Here's a breakdown of what you can achieve:

**Financial Calculations**: Design forms that automatically compute totals, taxes, discounts, and other financial metrics.

**Booking Forms**: Seamlessly handle date operations, availability checks, and booking calculations.

**Product Pricing**: Dynamically calculate product prices based on user inputs or predefined rules.

**Math Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic, percentages, and complex mathematical functions.

**Text Processing**: Manipulate text fields, concatenate strings, and format data.

**Date Operations**: Handle date differences, age calculations, and time-related tasks.

Advanced Operations:

**Distance Calculations**: Compute distances between locations.

**Chart Generation**: Create charts dynamically based on form data.

**Third-Party Service Integration**: Call external APIs or services for real-time data retrieval.

And the best part? All resulting forms are **mobile responsive**, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

The most remarkable aspect is that you donâ€™t need to hire a developer to create forms. With basic knowledge, you can have professional forms in minutes.

The form builder is entirely visual, offering a wide selection of controls (Text fields, Numbers, Currency, Date/time, Slider control, Email, Radio buttons, Checkboxes, Container fields, Multi-page control, QR code reader, Recording, Calculated fields, and many others). This versatile toolkit empowers you to create customized forms effortlessly.

== Other Notes ==


This section mainly contains notes on features of the form builder that are too detailed to include in the main description.

= Conditional rules =

It is possible to show or hide form fields (dependent fields) based on the options selected in checkbox fields, radio buttons, the options selected in dropdown menus, or the result of calculated fields.

The value of a dependent field is zero when it is hidden/disabled. The plugin excludes the disabled form fields from the submission.

[Additional details about the use of dependencies](https://cff.dwbooster.com/blog/2020/03/01/dependencies/ "Description about the use of dependencies")

= Predefined values =

The predefined values in the fields have two possible uses:

1- To fill the field by default. This makes it easier for the end-user to enter values.

2- Hint of the values to be entered in the field (like "Enter your name"). To use the predefined value as a placeholder, you must tick the "Hide predefined value on click" checkbox. The value will disappear once the user starts filling in the field. The calculated fields' equations ignore placeholders.

= The "User Instructions" attribute =

The "User instructions" attribute in the field settings allows you to instruct the user on how to fill in the field. By default, the instructions appear as smaller text on the public website. But they can be configured as tooltips.

= Adding CSS layout keywords =

The "Add CSS layout keywords" attribute in the fields settings allows you to apply CSS styles to fields. You must only enter the name of the CSS class names, and not their definitions.

You can define the CSS classes via the "Customize Form Design" attribute in the "Form Settings" tab. This attribute contains a CSS editor with syntax highlighting and error checking.

If you want to assign several class names to the field, separate them by space characters.

The plugin includes multiple predefined classes that you can assign to the form fields.

More information about the form's design can be found by reading the following post in the plugin's blog:

[Customizing the form's design](https://cff.dwbooster.com/blog/2020/01/12/form-design/ "Customizing the form's design")

The classes listed below allow you to align two, three, or four fields on the same line:

    column2
    column3
    column4

For example, if you want to put two fields on the same line, give both fields the class name "column2".

There are other variants for displaying several fields on the same line, such as container fields (Div or Fieldset). Container fields allow you to select the number of columns in your configuration. The following post describes all the alternatives for positioning the fields in the form:

[Formatting the form (distributing the fields in columns)](https://cff.dwbooster.com/blog/2019/01/06/columns/ "Formatting the form (distributing the fields in columns)")

= Multi-page form =

To create multi-page forms, you must insert "Page break" controls between fields belonging to different pages.

When the user presses the "Next Page" button, the plugin validates the fields in the current form. If there is any validation error (such as an unfilled required field), the plugin stops the "Next page" action.

= Hidden calculated fields =

Calculated fields include a checkbox in the configuration that allows them to be hidden from the public website. This feature is essential in those fields that are used to calculate intermediate values or when we want to show the results only in emails or thank you pages.

= Equation / Formula format for calculated fields =

Below, some possible formulas are included as examples, but the possibilities are endless.

* With simple mathematical operations:

    `fieldname1 + fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 * fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 / fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 - fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 - fieldname2`

* With mathematical operations involving multiple fields and grouped fields:

    `fieldname1 * (fieldname2 + fieldname3)`

* With rounding operations. Round the result to two decimal places:

    `PREC(fieldname2 / fieldname3, 2)`

* There are infinite number of formulas that can be created using complex structures. For example, the following formula includes conditional statements:

    `(function () {`
    `if (100 < fieldname3) return fieldname1 + fieldname2;`
    `if (fieldname3 <= 100) return fieldname1 * fieldname2;`
    `})();`

* For complex formulas/equations you must use the function format with return statement to return the result to the calculated field:

     `(function () {`
        `var result = 0;`
        `/* Your code here */`
        `return result;`
    `}) ();`

= Operations and operators to use in equations/formulas =

One of the "Calculated Fields Form" strengths is the ability to use any valid JavaScript code to implement the equations/formulas.

However, the plugin includes a wide variety of operations and operators to simplify the development process.

[Mathematical Operations and Operators](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#mathematical-module)

[Conditional Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#conditions-module)

[Field Handling Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#managing-fields-module)

[Operations for interacting with external services](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#connection-module)

[Operations for handling URLs and query strings](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#url-module)

In addition to the operation modules listed above, the Developer and Platinum versions of the plugin include additional modules:

[Date Time Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#datetime-module)

[Financial Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#financial-module)

[Distance and Travel Time Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#distance-module)

[Operations to generate charts](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#chart-module)

= Controls available in the form generator of the "Calculated Fields Form" =

The complete list of controls is available from this link: [CLICK HERE](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#common-fields)

= Create JavaScript variables from parameters received by "GET" or "POST", "SESSION" variables, or "COOKIES" to use in the equations =

The plugin includes the shortcode [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR] to generate JavaScript variables from parameters received by "GET" or "POST",  "SESSION" variables, or "COOKIES":

`[CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="..."]`

In the shortcode, you must replace the "..." symbols with the name of the parameter or variable. The variables are created as properties of the cff_var variable. For example, in the [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="my_var"] shortcode, you can access the variable value from the equations by using cff_var['my_var'], or cff_var.my_var

For example:

`[CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="varname"]`

You can use the variables generated through the shortcode [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR] in the formulas of the calculated fields: `fieldname1*cff_var.varname`

The complete list of parameters accepted by the variables shortcode is available at the following link: [CLICK HERE](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#javascript-variables)

= Tips for calculating prices =

One of the most frequent uses of our plugin is for price calculation. When displaying the price of a product, you may want to split the form into two pages. The first page would request the information needed to calculate the price, and the second page would include the calculated field with the final price. Also, you could use the "Instruct. Text" fields to indicate the terms, conditions, and validity period of the offer.

Note that you can make the "Instruct. Text" fields dependent on the calculated value. This allows you to vary the text displayed to the user depending on the calculated price, as the terms, conditions, or offers often depend on the transaction amount.

= ClassicPress =

This plugin is compatible with [ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net/).

The YITH WooCommerce Frequently Bought Together plugin lets you add product suggestions with a simple summary in each product page.

== Description ==
The right cross selling strategy in your shop is crucial because it affects conversion rates in a very significant way. Products suggested as **“frequently bought together”** are, in fact, much more appealing and customers who see them might be already interested in them. This way, conversion rates are really high.

YITH WooCommerce Frequently Bought Together plugin is the best choice for implementing this feature into your website. You can show products to a highly specific and selected target. Explicitly designed to let you make your offers in the most direct way ever, **a well-planned proposal has double advantages for shop owners and customers**. Your suggestions might allow them to save a lot of time and grant you a highly targeted advertising, which is always the most effective one.

**Main features:**

* Specify an unlimited number of suggested products for each single product of your shop
* Customise the title of the section “Frequently Bought Together”
* Customise text and colours of the button “Add to Cart” placed in the section “Frequently Bought Together”

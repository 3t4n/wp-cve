Automatically purge Cloudflare cache, including cache everything rules.

== Description ==

Automatically purge Cloudflare cache, including cache everything rules.

= Warning!!! =

This plugin is not for normal users! Read the whole [readme](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sunny/#description) and [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sunny/#faq) before installing.

Cloudflare cache everything rules breaks most WordPress dynamic functionalities:

* [WordPress Nonces](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces) will be cached
* Forms must be loaded via AJAX unless you’re using the USD$ 200 Cloudflare plan. [Learn more](https://github.com/TypistTech/sunny/issues/118#issuecomment-324325599)

Sunny shows a few admin notices in WP admin dashboard promoting the author's web development services every 2 weeks.They are dismissible via the `X` button on the right corner. See faq for more info.This is a free plugin, free as in free of charge and in freedom. You can always remove those notices without breaking other parts of Sunny.

The next major release of Sunny(v3.0.0) will require:

- PHP 7.1
- WordPress 4.9
- Properly working [WP Cron](https://typist.tech/articles/ensure-wp-cron-runs-on-time/)

= Features =

* Automatically purge Cloudflare `cache everything` rules' caches
* Use the latest Cloudflare API v4
* Support custom post type
* Hide admin bar from public-facing pages
* WP REST API support
* [Extendable Laravel-like container](https://github.com/Typisttech/sunny#extending-sunny)

= Debuggers =

Go `Sunny` --> `Debuggers`, it shows:

* All related urls to be purged for a given post
* Show targeted urls which always be purged
* `Cache Status` of a given URL

= How does Sunny different from Cloudflare's official plugin? =

At the time of writing, Cloudflare's [official plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloudflare/) doesn't purge `cache everything` rules' caches. Here comes Sunny! Sunny focus on purging caches when needed.

= Compatibility =

* Works with Cloudflare's [official plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloudflare/)
* Works with [WP Cloudflare Guard (Automatically create firewall rules to block dangerous IPs.)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cloudflare-guard/)

= Things You Need to Know =

* You need PHP `7.0` or later
* You need WordPress `4.7` or later
* You need a Cloudflare account (free plan is okay)
* This plugin was not built by [Cloudflare, Inc](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

= For Developers =

Sunny is open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/TypistTech/sunny). Feel free to make [pull requests](https://github.com/Typisttech/sunny/pulls).

You can also tweak `Sunny` to work for you by [extending its Laravel-like container](https://github.com/Typisttech/sunny#extending-sunny).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I purge extra URLs? =

Post related urls are filterable by `Strategies` and `sunny_post_related_urls`. See examples on [Sunny Purge Extra URLs Example](https://github.com/TypistTech/sunny-purge-extra-urls-example).

If you don't understand the example code, [hire me](https://typist.tech/contact/) instead.

= How can I tweak Sunny to work for my special needs?=

Extend its [Laravel-like container](https://github.com/Typisttech/sunny#extending-sunny).

= What version of PHP do I need? =

PHP `7.0` or later.

= What version of WordPress do I need? =

WordPress `4.7` or later.

= What to do when `Parse error: syntax error`? =

If you encountered this error:

`Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ‘:’, expecting ‘;’ or ‘{‘ in wp-content/plugins/sunny/src/Sunny.php on line XX`

You probably running on a old version of PHP. Upgrade your server to PHP `7.0` or later.

= Unable to dismiss advertisements =

Sunny shows a few admin notices in WP admin dashboard promoting the author's web development services every 2 weeks.
They are dismissible via the `X` button on the right corner.

Why do they don’t go away?
Your caching settings are incorrect! Possible issues:

* Database query caches not purged when updated
* Object cache expire time too long
* Cloudflare is caching `wp-admin`

Sunny works with database query caching and object caching. This plugin won't fix improper server configuration.

But... other plugins don't have this issue?

I doubt. Sunny saves/retrieves those notices via [Options API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Options_API) which commonly used in plugins. Thus, other plugins should get outdated options as well. Hire a developer to check your site!

If you still not convinced, submit a pull request with failing test case via [GitHub](https://github.com/TypistTech/sunny).

= Should I install Sunny version 1 because of PHP 5 incompatibles? =

No. Sunny version 1 uses Cloudflare API v1 which [deprecated since 9th November, 2016](https://blog.cloudflare.com/sunsetting-api-v1-in-favor-of-cloudflares-current-client-api-api-v4/). Either update your server or uninstall Sunny.

= Don't know how to update PHP? =

* Contact you hosting company
* Switch to a better hosting such as [WP Engine](https://typist.tech/go/wp-engine-isnt-business-worth-29-month/) or [Kinsta](https://typist.tech/go/kinsta-staging-environment/)
* Hire me [https://typist.tech/contact](https://typist.tech/contact)

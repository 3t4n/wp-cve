For bbPress - adds any combination of topics, replies and totals under the authors avatar in topics and replies

== Description ==
This plugin for bbpress shows any combination of the total topics, replies and total count under the avatar or within the post content on each topic/reply view in bbpress, and allows you to label these as you wish eg “Topics Created : 253″ or “Topics – 253″

You can choose to link the number counts to each user's profile page (topics, replies, and engagements) or just display the number counts without links.

Additionally 3 shortcodes are included that allow display of the counts of the logged in user
[display-topic-count]
[display-reply-count]
[display-total-count]
[display-top-users]


which can be used on pages

see the settings shortcodes tab for details

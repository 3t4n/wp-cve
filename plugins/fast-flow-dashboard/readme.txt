== Description ==

Data dashboard, user tagging and settings plugin for Fast Flow plugins system.

FastFlow opens WordPress up to the world of sales and marketing automation giving you a powerful user tagging system with multiple data dashboards.

At the heart of FastFlow are Fast Tags. Every user can have different Fast Tags applied and then these tags can be used to interact with both your WordPress site and your other apps and services.

Using Fast Tags and our growing number of integrations you can apply tags to users at any stage of your marketing and sales process.

FastFlow can then be used to sync your users across different platforms which would otherwise not be talking with each other and display data based on the tags your contacts have.

Fast Flow is designed to work seamlessly with [Fast Member](https://fastmember.com), an all in one WordPress based membership platform for securely selling your digital content.

Bulk Product Sync is a WooCommerce plugin to manage products with Google Sheets™ in bulk.

== Description ==
Bulk Product Sync with Google Sheets™ is a creative, quick, and easy way to use Google Sheets™ to bulk update or create products and categories for your WooCommerce store. 
To add new products to WooCommerce or even to make a single adjustment, you must go through a long-form (product edit page). Your time is wasted while you wait for login, website updates, and several clicks.
Use Google Sheets™ to add products and categories, and it only takes one click to add thousands of products to your store. Please watch this video instruction to learn more about the features and how to use it.

== Use Cases ==
**Opening a new store** *Add all of your products to the Google sheet, select `Sync Products` and bask in the joy.*
**Managing an existing store** *To manage any updates or new products, export all of your products from your store to Google Sheets.™*
**Managing the stock** If the present solution's stock management is driving you crazy, use Bulk Product Sync to add `manage_stock` and `quantity` columns to the sheet, and you'll be free of the problem.
**Managing the price** *Price changes were frequent due to the economy's instability; however, Bulk Product Sync will now adjust product prices in bulk for your store.*
**Variable products** *In WooCommerce, it is difficult to create variations and variable products; however, Bulk Product Sync has made this process quite simple and quick.*
**Much more ...** *As per your needs*

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin and activate it
2. Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Google Products
3. Enter your Google Credentials
4. Enter WooCommerce API/Secret Keys

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is the difference between Pro and Free versions? =
The only import option in the free version is from a Google Sheet™ to the store, and some fields, such as images, and variable products, cannot be imported. As mentioned above in the PRO features list, you can export (from store to Google Sheet™) and do much more when using the Pro version.
= Can I fetch my existing products/categories? =
Yes, in Pro version
= Should I need to connect with my own Google Account? =
Yes
= When connecting for the first time to Google Sheet™, why do we notice a warning? Is this harmful? =
It's because the scripts we uploaded to the Google Sheet™ require certain permissions in order to run. Allowing these permissions is not problematic, since, for privacy reasons, we only have access to the current Google Sheet™, not the whole Google Drive.

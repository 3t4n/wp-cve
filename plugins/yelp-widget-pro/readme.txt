While the Reviews Block for Yelp can help you display your Yelp reviews on your website for free, we have an even better solution for you! 

*WP Business Reviews* is a **significant upgrade** to our free reviews blocks for Google and Yelp. With WP Business Reviews (WPBR), you can display reviews from many platforms, including:

* Google 
* Yelp 
* Facebook 
* WooCommerce 
* Zomato 
* Trustpilot 

When you use WP Business Reviews, you also gain more control over the style of your displayed reviews as well as which reviews you show. WPBR also allows you to mix and match your reviews across platforms. So, your Google and WooCommerce reviews can be displayed right alongside your Facebook and Yelp reviews.

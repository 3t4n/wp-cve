An archive widget that reconstructs the stock widget into an accordion by year with month children.

== Description ==

Accordion Archive Widget is exactly what the name implies. It recreates the stock archive widget, but this time around the widget is laid out as an accordion. It gives you the years of the archive, and then when the year is clicked it expands to show the months.

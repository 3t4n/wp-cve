== Description ==

Allows .heic uploads to the Media Library. Creates .webp or .jpg copies of .heic images when they are uploaded. An optional feature replaces the original upload instead of creating a copy.

Creation of .webp or .jpg copies usually works on servers running ImageMagick 7 or above. Check Settings → Media → HEIC Support after activating to see if your server provides ImageMagick.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `heic-support` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen (**Plugins → Installed Plugins**).

Check the page at Media → HEIC Support after activating to see if your server provides ImageMagick 7.

== Screenshots ==

1. The settings are located at Settings → Media → HEIC Support in the dashboard.

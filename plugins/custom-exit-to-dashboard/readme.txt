This plugin is made by need to modify Elementor editor exit to dashboard link.
For instance, before activating this plugin, you can only get to current post/page wordpress editor page after pressing “Exit to Dashboard” in wordpress editor.


WHERE THIS PLUGIN GETS us?

At this moment, this plugin redirects you to from editing a post to All posts, Pages to all pages, Elementor Templates to elementor template library.

What if you have a custom post type in elementor editor? Then  this is forwards at the moment to wordpress Admin Dashboard. I’m am developing the  add it a feature - you choose your post type, and then you choose a link where to point this plugin to exit the dashboard link. But it’s in development at the moment.

All the donations are kindly appreciated!

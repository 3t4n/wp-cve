A widget that inserts a horizontal rule or a custom div.

== Description ==

Separator Widget inserts a horizontal rule ( `<hr>` ) or a custom div ( `<div class="my-separator"></div>` ) in your widget area. Each widget can be set to one of those options.

No extra styling is added so you are free to style them however you want it.
Add your custom `hr` styling to your CSS or use `.my-separator` if you prefer that option.

Free and easy to use!

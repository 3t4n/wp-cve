== Description ==

**This plugin will add a new content field to your Woocommerce product categories and tags that will be displayed right after your list of products in the product category/tag page. You can also change where the description it's displayed based on your needs. There's also an option to hide this new description and show it anywhere you want through a shortcode.**

This will allow you to split your product categories/tags content between the top and bottom parts of the page. You can use this bottom field to add additional content to your product category/tag to improve your SEO, while keeping the products visible in the top part of the page and improving the UX.

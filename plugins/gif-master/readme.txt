GIF Master WordPress plugin allows you to insert gifs from Giphy and Tenor into your WordPress pages and posts.

== Description ==

Ever wanted to use gifs in your content? Look no further. GIF Master does just that with unlimited free gifs powered by Giphy and Tenor.

You will see an additional gif button in the post/page editor and clicking this will open a new popup where you can search for your favorite gifs and insert them in your content. It's that easy!

Notice: If you are using some page builder or Guttenberg and not classic editor, you can insert a classic visual/html block and then you will see the gif button.

This plugin doesn't generate any gif on it's own and relies on services provided from [Giphy](https://giphy.com/) and [Tenor](https://tenor.com/) to get the gifs from these sites with attribution.

You would need to create accounts on Giphy and Tenor and get your API keys from there. Both services are free. Check their terms of service and other guidelines as below:
Tenor - [Terms of Service](https://tenor.com/legal-terms) and [API Terms](https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation#apiterms)
Giphy - [User Terms of Service](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020027752-GIPHY-Terms-of-Service) and [Privacy Policy](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032872931)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

See http://www.authorsure.com/category/faq/ for the full list of questions and answers about AuthorSure

* Why is Google AuthorShip important?  By verifying your authorship with Google, your face will appear in the search results and will tend to give your search entries a better click-through rate than entries without a human face.

* What is AuthorRank?  Google is now using the authority of the verified author of a page as a ranking factor in the SERPs. For more details see http://www.blindfiveyearold.com/author-rank/

* How Long Will It Take For My Face To Show Up In The Search Results? Our experience is that that it takes between 5 days and 6 months for Google to show author images in the search results; it seems that the more often you publish original content and interact on social media channels, the quicker your face will be featured in Google SERPs.

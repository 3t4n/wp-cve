Trusted by 20,000+ WordPress sites and a 4.5 star rating on WordPress.org, The Events Calendar Shortcode and Block is the solution you’ve been after :)

== How to use The Events Calendar Shortcode ==

You can use the shortcode or block to add a list of your events, filtered by various options. Here’s an example of how you’d show the next 8 events in the category festival:

`[ecs-list-events cat="festival" limit="8"]`

You can also filter the events in the shortcode and choose from the following options:

* Category: show events from specific categories.
* Number of events: choose the number of events to show.
* Event order: Order in which your events are shown (latest first or last).
* Event dates: Show or hide the date.
* Event venue: Show or hide the venue.
* Event excerpt: Show or hide the event excerpt, and set an excerpt length.
* Event content details: Change the order the event details are displayed.
* Thumbnail: Show or hide a thumbnail image.
* View all events link: Choose whether to include a “view all events” link or not.
* Events from a specific month: show only events from specific months (including current or next month).
* Previous events: Show previous events.
* Hide started events: Hide events when their start time passes.

This gives you full control over how your events are displayed, and is perfect for non-profits, charities, businesses, conferences, and anyone with a WordPress website showing events.

You’ll find a full list of how to use these options in the shortcode below in the plugin’s FAQs or <a href="https://eventcalendarnewsletter.com/events-calendar-shortcode-pro-options/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=tecs-readme&utm_content=description">on our documentation page</a>.

== Who's using The Events Calendar Shortcode? ==

**William Penn University** is a private liberal arts university located in Oskaloosa, Iowa. The university offers more than 20 majors through seven academic divisions, with a focus on leadership, technology, and inspired potential. As an institution that hosts various events throughout the year, William Penn University needed an efficient way to display and manage its event calendar on its website. The university chose to implement The Events Calendar Shortcode plugin to streamline event management and improve the overall user experience.

The university decided to use The Events Calendar Shortcode plugin, which integrates seamlessly with The Events Calendar WordPress Plugin. The plugin allows the university to display a list of events using a shortcode or a WordPress block. This makes it easy for technical and non-technical users to add events to the website without any coding knowledge.

**365Austin** is a popular website that curates and shares the best events, activities, and experiences in Austin, Texas. With a comprehensive event calendar, the platform aims to make it easier for locals and tourists alike to discover and participate in exciting events happening in the city. To improve event management and user experience, 365Austin chose to implement The Events Calendar Shortcode plugin on its website.

**CREST** (Center for Research in Economics and Statistics) is a renowned research center that brings together researchers from various fields, including economics, finance, sociology, and statistics. To facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among its members and the wider academic community, CREST hosts various seminars, workshops, and conferences. A comprehensive event calendar on the CREST website plays a crucial role in keeping researchers informed and engaged.

Each event listing includes essential information such as the title, date, time, speaker, and a brief description of the topic. The calendar is designed to be user-friendly and easily accessible, allowing researchers to stay informed about upcoming events relevant to their fields of interest.

= Can I use this plugin to list my events using the new WordPress 5.0 editor (Gutenberg)? =

Yes! There is now a block to list your events anywhere in a page or post, just click "+" in the top-left and search for The Events Calendar Block (under Common).

= How do I use this shortcode in a widget? =

You can put the shortcode in a text widget (as of WordPress 4.7). If a regular text widget doesn't work, put the shortcode in a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/black-studio-tinymce-widget/">Visual Editor Widget</a>.

= Can I use this plugin to list my events using Elementor? =

Yes! Just place the shortcode inside an Elementor HTML widget. While the Elementor Shortcode widget may work, <a href="https://eventcalendarnewsletter.com/how-to-fix-the-events-calendar-shortcode-not-working/#elementor">the HTML widget is recommended</a>.

= What are the classes for styling the list of events? =

By default the plugin does not include styling. Events are listed in ul li tags with appropriate classes for styling with a bit of CSS.

* ul class="ecs-event-list"
* li class="ecs-event" and "ecs-featured-event" (if featured)
* event title link is H4 class="entry-title summary"
* date class is time
* venue class is venue
* span .ecs-all-events
* p .ecs-excerpt

The [pro version of the plugin](https://eventcalendarnewsletter.com/the-events-calendar-shortcode?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=tecs-readme-faq-calendar&utm_content=description) has the option to put `design="calendar"` in the shortcode (or pick Calendar as the design with the block) to show a calendar view of the events you want.

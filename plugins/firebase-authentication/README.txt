This plugin allows login into WordPress using Firebase user credentials and maps Firebase user data to WordPress user profile.

== Description ==

**WordPress Firebase Authentication Plugin** allows you to login to WordPress sites using your Firebase user login credentials or via Social Login.
<a href="https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-firebase-authentication/" target="_blank">WordPress Firebase Authentication</a> works using the default WordPress login page. We support <a href="https://plugins.miniorange.com/firebase-woocommerce-integration/" target="_blank">Firebase WooCommerce Integration</a> and other third-party login pages along with custom login forms.

*	**Support for Firebase Login and Registration form Shortcode** : Using login form shortcode, users can enter their Firebase credentials to login into the WP site, and using the registration form shortcode, users can register into the WordPress site, and that user is also auto created in Firebase with an email address and password.

* Â  **WordPress login with Firebase JWT**: WordPress login with Firebase JWT allows you to create a user login session on a WordPress site using their Firebase JWT token, eliminating the need to enter their login credentials again. This is highly recommended when there are multiple websites/applications and the user is already logged in to any of them.

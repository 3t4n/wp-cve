Prevent public access to WordPress files and folders. Protect downloads from public access, Role-based folder access, and User base folder access.

== Description ==
[WordPress Prevent files/ folders](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-media-restriction) access provides the easiest way to protect WordPress files from public users so that your wordpress media library can be accessed only by **WordPress logged in** users or users with **specific roles/capabilities**. Your *ebooks*, *pdfs*, *other important files*, etc., can be **protected from google indexing** so that data is protected from getting stolen. Control users access to media library, Control users access to the WordPress upload folder or sub folders, and restrict all the files published on your WordPress site.

For restricted Content you can choose to redirect users to **403 forbidden page**, your **custom page**, **WordPress login page**, SSO login page (if you are using OAuth or SAML SSO). 

**No change required** or **no manual work** needed to create a private link to protect your wordpress media file. Our plugin takes care of your media library or via Media, Pages, or Posts.

We support a level of security where you can choose either _**cookie-based**_ restriction or _**session-based**_ restriction.
Also, we support Apache and Nginx servers to prevent direct access to the WordPress media library and therefore protect the media library for public or restricted users.

It prevents private download of the media files from public access and only the logged-in users or specific user roles can access and download the wordpress media files.

We also support media/files/folders Restriction based on NFT holding in the user crypto wallet. We support any level of customization according to your requirement.

##File-Based Protection

WordPress Prevent file/folder access is developed to allow you to protect wordpress media file in your customized way. It will prevent direct access from media library **based on their extension**. 
`
You can protect file types below:

* Images - Every type of image files can be protected. eg: jpeg, jpg, gif, png, bmp, webp, pfg, ico, psd, etc.
* Videos - Every type of video files can be protected. eg: mp4, m4a, m4v, f4v, f4a, m4b, m4r, f4b, mov, 3gp, avi etc.
* Documents - Every type of document files can be protected. eg: doc, docx, html, pdf, txt, ppt, xls, xlsx, pptx, odt.
`
##Redirect

WordPress Prevent file/folder access provides **redirect options**. This allow you to redirect the restricted users to any WordPress page of your website.

* **403 forbidden page** _(DEFAULT)_ - _Users will be shown 403 forbidden pages with a restricted access message._
* **Display custom page** - _We can redirect users to any WordPress custom page when they try to access restricted files or folders._
* **WordPress login** - _Users will be redirected to the WordPress default login page._
* **IDP login** - _Users will redirect to the selected IDP (SAML/OAuth) login page and after IdP authentication they can see the restricted content._

##Private Directory/Protected folder

* Our plugin also gives you a [Private Directory](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-media-restriction#mediarestriction) where you can add files of all extension types and restrictions will be applied to all files inside the private directory.

##Membership Based Media Restriction.

* WordPress Prevent files/ folder allows you to secure media library and control wp-content/uploads access based on the membership purchased by the user.

##Folder Based Protection

* WordPress Prevent files/ folders access allows you to protect your folders too, the **wp-content or uploads** folder where all the wordpress media files like images, videos, and document files are stored will also be protected.
* Users have the option to **protect a particular month's media files or sub folder in uploads directory.**.
* **User-Based Restriction** - A particular user can access only a particular folder. (Admin would be able to access all the folders)
* **Role Base folder access** - Uploads folder or subfolders can be restricted for public access and allowed folder access to users with specific role. (Admin would be able to access all the folders)

We support **[LearnDash](https://www.learndash.com/)** and other LMS to restrict files and folders according to different groups and specific user roles.

You can customize the restriction rules and use them as per your needs.

This functionality operates at the server level, thus if the Apache server rules don't work, or also the WP Engine, Siteground, and other servers like this run on an Nginx server, which requires the use of Nginx configuration rules. If you face any issues please email us at _info@xecurify.com_ or _oauthsupport@xecurify.com_. We would recommend you to please ensure your PHP server and rules first which will work on your server before purchasing it or else **contact us we will help you to set up the plugin according to your requirements on your site.**

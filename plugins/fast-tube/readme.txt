Fast and easy way to insert videos from YouTube right into your WordPress blog posts or pages.

== Description ==

Fast and easy way to insert videos from YouTube right into your WordPress blog posts or pages. It doesn't matter if you paste the whole YouTube video URL or just the video ID... Surround it by square brackets and Fast Tube will do the job. The plugin also checks if the video ID is valid so don't worry if you have similar information on your posts or pages - it won't be lost, hidden or removed.

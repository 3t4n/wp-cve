Add a 5 star rating and review from the site organization if the Schema markup does not already have an 'aggregateRating' property.

== Description ==

<!-- about -->

**Includes a 5 Star Rating in Schema markup:**

1. If the Schema markup does not have an 'aggregateRating' property.
2. If Google allows an 'aggregateRating' property for that Schema type.

Google allows an 'aggregateRating' property for these Schema types and their sub-types:

* Book
* Course
* Event
* HowTo (includes Recipe)
* LocalBusiness
* Movie
* Product
* SoftwareApplication

If the Schema type in the Document SSO metabox is not one of these types (or one of their sub-types), then a 5 star rating cannot be added, as doing so would trigger an error in the Google search console. [See Google's Review snippet documentation for additional information.](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/review-snippet)

<h3>WPSSO Add Five Stars is a Fallback Solution</h3>

The Google's Review Snippet technical guidelines reminds us to:

> [Make sure the reviews and ratings you mark up are readily available to users from the marked-up page. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has review content.](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/review-snippet#technical-guidelines)

The WPSSO Add Five Stars add-on includes a 5 star rating *if the document Schema markup does not already have an 'aggregateRating' property*. It is always preferable to include actual ratings and reviews from your visitors and/or customers in the webpage. The WPSSO Add Five Stars add-on can be used in combination with any of the following third-party plugins and service APIs, or the [WPSSO Ratings and Reviews](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-ratings-and-reviews/) add-on.

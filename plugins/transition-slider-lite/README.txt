= iFrame Element - PRO =

Transition Slider is now even more flexible with a new feature of HTML source inside slides! You can insert any HTML content inside slides and fully customize it's size, animation etc. This way you can display any possible webpage you can imagine from the web, inside your slider.

= Slider Thumbnails =

You can display thumbnail images in your slider. This feature gives you flexibility to enhance user experiance, due to better view of your slider content in advance. Thumbnails are fully customisable so you can easily change thier position (top/right/bottom/left), choose to display them inside slider or outside of slider, you can set any thumbnails size, and even change their color, background and border.

= Button Templates =

We have created 12 sleek button templates. With one click you can add them to your slide. 5 button templates are included in this version and additional 7 button templates you'll get in PRO version. Button elements can be customized as well.

= Text Templates =

We have created 16 best text templates with most appealing fonts. With one click you can add them to your slide. 5 text templates are included in this version and additional 11 text templates you'll get in PRO version. Still, you can customize your texts manually, without limits.

10 pre-made navigation arrow styles are included, yet, you can customize navigation elements to perfectly match your website style.

= Pagination =

Just as navigation arrows, 6 pre-made pagination styles are included, which are fully customisable. Also, you can choose to make them dynamic, or turn them off.

= Great UX =

Day by day, we are greatly improving user experience by improving Transition Slider's interface design and usability.

= Fully customisable =

Transition slider is fully customisable, which means that you have full control over visual content of slider. Each slider element can be customized, from navigation, pagination, sizes, shadows, animations to even adding your custom css as top level of unlimited customisation ability.

= Draggable Slides =

Transition Slider has now draggable slides, which makes awesome WebGL effects even more attractive. You can drag slides with touch or mouse, in both directions.

= Lazy Loading =

Slide images, videos and layer elements are only loaded when the relevant slides are displayed (all of the slider’s images are NOT loaded up-front). This way we keep attention to avoid heavy impact on user's broadband and improve user experience.

= High Performance =

Slider is rendering only when it is visible in viewport, so you can have multiple full width sliders on the page without problem. This enables you to create rich website with animations, videos and images with high performance.

= Parallax effect =

With parallax scrolling feature you can create depth and make Slider even more visually superb!

= Infinite Looping =

First slide is seamlessly displayed after the last slide without any carousel rewind.

= Optional always visible Layer =

There's great new option to have one Layer in between slide image and slide elements, which can be used to "darken" the slide image and to make texts and buttons stand out more on your slider. This extra Layer can be fully customized as changing the color, transparency and size of the Layer.

= WebGl or CSS transition =

If your preference is to have lightning fast slider and transitions between slides and you don't wann't to use advanced transitions, we made it possible as well with CSS transitions.

= Mouse scroll navigation =

You can navigate through slides with mouse scroll.

= Autoplay Slider=

Get benefit from timer driven autoplaying slides so your users get visual representation before the actual interaction with slider. Also, you can enable progress indicator option for users to see how long each slide will be displaying before switching to Next Slide.

= Autoplay Slides - PRO =

In PRO version each Slide can have different autoplay timer. This would be of great use for displaying different products on image slides and videos on video slides. This way you can make certain slides last "longer" or "shorter".

= Randomize Slides =
Each time your webpage loads, slides can be displayed randomly.

= Custom actions for Layer Elements - PRO =
Each Layer element (Text, Button, Image) can have a custom action. For example, you can create set of tabs (buttons) and make each of them to switch to certain slide on click.

= Static Elements - PRO =

Layer elements like Text, Button and Image can be marked as "static". This means that you can make an element visible over all slides, all the time, which makes Transition Slider even more insightful.

= What our users say =

<blockquote>"The support is amazing, this plugin is amazing. I would definitely recommend this plugin to everybody on wordpress. One of the easiest plugin to use and amazing capabilities." - oesalazar123</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Boom its a WOW! Plugin. quick & lovely support, completely satisfied." - agentkiller007</blockquote>
<blockquote>"I have used the lite version on two websites. Extremely user-friendly (important consideration for clients) and lightweight plugin. Superb all round." - alexwent</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The free plugin version of Transition Slider is already feature-rich packed so that you can test out any settings needed. It has more options available for free than I have seen at a different similar slider. Beyond that, it is even easier to use. The only caveat is that the free version is not having settings for mobile devices and I highly recommend purchasing the full version to get all features including fine-grained settings for mobile devices. The pricing is very fair and combating with other plugins that are less feature-rich, less easy to use, and much more expensive." - yogieanamcara</blockquote>
<blockquote>"It’s a very fine slider with great effects – thanks!" - glaeskewpr</blockquote>
<blockquote>"This slider is loaded with features, and is easy to get going. And the support is absolutely phenomenal!" - stevemullen</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The makers are very responsive and helped me with an issue I was having. Which resulted in a new update that made this slider plugin one of the best out there!" - bluesblue1</blockquote>

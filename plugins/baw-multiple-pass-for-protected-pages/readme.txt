Add more than 1 password to your protected pages, also administrators and page's authors can view the protected pages without password.

== Description ==
You can now add passwords as many as you need on every protected page. 

Why? Because you can protect page and give your client a personnal password, not just a random pasword or everyone.

Option: If you are logged as admin or the page's author, you won't need to enter password.

Option: If you set a list of child pages, just change any password (parent page or any child) and all the password for the hierarchy will be updated!

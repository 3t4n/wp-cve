Integrate Gravity Forms with Táve Studio Manager

== Description ==

This plugin adds Táve integration to Gravity Forms on your wordpress
installation. This allows you to create forms that will transmit that form data
to Táve and creating a new lead.

For complete help details see the [Support Site](http://help.tave.com/getting-started/contact-forms/using-gravity-forms)

== Installation ==

Install [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/).

Install this plugin. Add your Táve Studio Manager `Secret Key` and
Táve Studio Manager `Alias` info to the settings page which can be found in
[Settings > Integrations > New Lead API](https://tave.com/app/settings/new-lead-api)
section of Táve.  Once a Gravity Form is created, you can go to the settings section
of the form and map the form fields to the Táve fields.

The most common fields are below:
  * FirstName
  * LastName
  * Email
  * HomePhone
  * MobilePhone
  * WorkPhone
  * Source
  * EventDate
  * JobType
  * Message

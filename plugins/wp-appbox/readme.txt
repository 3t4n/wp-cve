With WP-Appbox you can add beautiful mobile app badges to your WordPress posts and pages simply by adding a shortcode.


== Description ==

With WP-Appbox you can add beautiful mobile app badges to your WordPress posts and pages simply by adding a shortcode. WP-Appbox supports the following app stores:

Apps & Software:
* Amazon App Shop
* Apple App Store
* F-Droid
* Google Play Store
* Huawei AppGallery (highly experimental!)
* Microsoft Store
* Snapcraft
* WordPress-Plugins

Browser Extensions:
* Chrome Web Store
* Microsoft Edge-Add-ons
* Firefox Add-ons
* Opera Add-ons

Games:
* GOG.com (Good Old Games)
* Steam (only single games)

= Usage of the shortcode =

All stores are integrated in a short code and can be inserted via button in the WordPress editor. The structure of the short code is always the following:

[appbox *storename* *app-id* *style*]

The order does not matter - as long as "appbox" is on the front. The blind names are: amazonapps, appstore, chromewebstore, fdroid, firefoxaddon, firefoxmarketplace, goodoldgames, googleplay, operaaddons, steam, windowsstore and wordpress. How to get the ID of the corresponding apps is illustrated in the settings for WP-Appbox. The default format is "simple", alternatively there is also an ad with "compact", "screenshots" and "screenshots-only".

There is another special feature for the App Store: With Universal Apps you can decide whether you want to get screenshots of the iPhone, iPad and the Watch App, or for example only of the iPhone, only of the iPad or only of the Watch App. All you need to do is simply attach a "-iphone", "-ipad" or "-watch" to the ID of the app. Example: 392502056-ipad.

By the way, the special feature is also available for the Windows Store: Here, too, only the mobile screenshots or those of the desktop version can be displayed. All you have to do is attach a "-mobile" or "-desktop" to the App-ID. Example: 392502056-mobile.

= Further Features =

* Display a QR code with MouseOver
* Adaptation to mobile devices with smaller displays
* Adaptation to the feed output
* Caching of data for performance purposes
* Use of the Microsoft Private Affiliate Program via Impact
* Use of user-specific Affiliate IDs
* Fully customizable via HTML and CSS

= Requirements =
* PHP min. 5.3
* WordPress min. 3.4
* Server with allow_url_fopen, cURL (curl_init and curl_exec) and mb_eregi enabled
* Outgoing requests must be allowed

= Support =
Support requests and problems should ideally be reported directly on the [Blog](https://tchgdns.de/wp-appbox-app-badge-fuer-google-play-mac-app-store-windows-store-windows-phone-store-co/ "Blog") or even better via [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@marcelismus "Mastodon"). I can't promise a quick solution for every problem, but I try to solve every problem. ;-)

= Logo =
The logo of the WP-Appbox comes from [Till](https://twitter.com/craive "@craive on Twitter"), to whom I am deeply indebted. \o/

= Installation =
1. Download und unpack the package
2. Upload the plugin folder to "/wp-content/plugins/
3. Activate the plugin in WordPress

Simply extract it into the plugin folder of WordPress and activate it.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
  
= Which server requirements are necessary? =
The server must run at least PHP 5.3 and support cURL and mb_eregi.

= Can the output of the box be adapted to the theme design? =
Yes, all elements of the WP-Appbox can be customized via CSS. It is also possible to deactivate the CSS stylesheet of the plugin in the settings. In addition, you can create your own templates for the output (see below).

= How can I create my own templates? =
You can simply copy the existing standard templates (folder "tpl") into your theme folder. The files can be given the following names:

* your-theme-folder/wpappbox-simple.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox-compact.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox-screenshots.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox-screenshots-only.php

Or just put the templates inside a folder called "wp-appbox" and keep the original names:
 
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox/simple.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox/compact.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox/screenshots.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox/screenshots-only.php

In the user-defined template files, the output can be adjusted to any desired value. The available variables can be found in the original files. ;-)

= Are AMP plugins supported? =
Basically, yes. However, the CSS of the WP-Appbox has to be implemented manually into your AMP page. How this works depends on your plugin.

= Why are the QR codes scaled down from 400x400 pixels? =
The QR code generator from Google has the peculiarity that the QR codes are created only throughout the fixed size. The shorter the URL, the smaller the code becomes and the higher the value "margin". This cannot be corrected with a "margin=0" value. Whether it is a feature or a bug is discussed in the Google Groups.

= The Chrome Web Store only displays the first screenshot =
Unfortunately Google only loads the first screenshot into the HTML output of the Chrome Web Store, all other screenshots are dynamically reloaded. Therefore the output of several screenshots via WP-Appbox is not possible at the moment.

= Is WP-Appbox compliant with DSGVO? =

Basically: yes. But it depends on the settings. The plugin itself does not store any user data. However, external images from Apple, Google, Amazon and Co. are integrated. Depending on the interpretation of the DSGVO, this is problematic. If you don't want to supplement your data protection information, you can use two possible options:
 
* Activate the image proxy, which embeds external images in the WP appbox using its own URL. However, this can impair performance, especially with a large number of page calls.
* Activate the image cache. All images are stored on your own server. This variant is always recommended, because it improves performance and the images are still displayed even if the app is no longer available in the respective store. ;-)

= Is the Gutenberg editor supported? =
A first implementation is available. However, this is experimental in nature and is not officially supported. With WordPress 6.2 there are problems with the block, but so far I have not found a solution. Classic Editor is therefore recommended ;)

= Why isn't the Amazon Product Advertising API 5.0 used? =
The PA-API 5.0 has a request limit, which is currently still very buggy. Also, unlike version 4.0, no images (icons and screenshots) are returned for Android Apps and Alexa Skills. Therefore I have currently decided to remove the PA-API. Should Amazon extend version 5.0, it will of course be implemented again.

= Why are the requests for Amazon sent to the Google Cache? =
Amazon has a very strong and "good working" bot detection. Therefore I had to resort to this workaround. It is not perfect, but the only alternative would be to remove Amazon from the WP appbox completely... :-/

== Description ==

Choose from over 585 icons and insert into the text editor with just a click!

This plugin was designed to make adding icons to text areas extremely simple and quick. A lot of the time, your text areas could use icons, but the time it takes to design them, upload them, insert them, and more means you just decide against it altogether. 

With this extremely simple plugin, you can start sprucing up your text areas with icons with just a click. This plugin was initially designed as a companion to the MP Stacks plugin my Mint Plugins - which is an amazing page builder for WordPress and utilizes text areas quite a lot. We decided to go one step further and make this plugin work with ANY text area - and not just MP Stacks ones. If you'd like to try it out with the free MP Stacks page building plugin, check it out here: https://mintplugins.com/mp-stacks

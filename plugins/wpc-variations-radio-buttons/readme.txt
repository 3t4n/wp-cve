WPC Variations Radio Buttons will replace dropdown select with radio buttons for the buyer easier in selecting the variations.

== Description ==

**WPC Variations Radio Buttons for WooCommerce** is a blowing hit designed especially for helping store owners bring about a more visitor-friendly interface. When it comes to choosing an option from variable products, customers now don’t have to click on each option or browse from the drop down list in order to attain product info. By adding radio buttons, all variations and all attributes will be shown at one screen only. Making decisions now is a task of much less effort now to your visitors.

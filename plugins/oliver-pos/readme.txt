== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need anything else to use this plugin? =

Oliver POS is designed to work specifically as a WooCommerce Point of Sale. So, you’ll need access to a wordpress site with WooCommerce. Products, orders, and customers (along with a series of other datasets) are synced into Oliver POS automatically. Products, their inventories, attributes and categories are managed through WooCommerce, so it’s important that the WooCommerce shop have all this setup when you install Oliver POS.

Hardware:

Oliver POS is designed to run in ANY web browser. As a result, all you need is a web-enabled device with a modern browser (we recommend Chrome). To date, we have tested Oliver POS on Mac and PC, as well as iPad and Android tablets.

Receipt printing is done through the default printer that is connected to the device.

Data entry is done through the mouse and keyboard for Mac and PC, and through touch on iPad and Android devices.

When it comes to your live implementation, you’ve got four options:
* Oliver POS point of sale terminal, running our Android app.
* PC or Mac through Chrome with a mouse and keyboard.
* iPad or Android through Chrome using the touch interface.
* iPad running our iOS App. (!Coming soon!)

There are options to add other hardware as needed including:
* Printers
* Barcode Scanners
* Cashdrawers
* Integrated Payment Terminals

If you have a specific piece of hardware you’d like to integrate, let us know through support@oliverpos.com or through our website.

= Is there a web/desktop version of Oliver POS? =

Yes! It is accessible through [sell.oliverpos.com](https://hubs.ly/H0lMGsd0).

Our web register is one of the most popular ways for our customers to try out Oliver POS (we also have people using it as their primary shop register). 

Having a web register [sell.oliverpos.com](https://hubs.ly/H0lMGsd0) also allows us to support a wide variety of hardware options.

= What payment methods does Oliver POS Support? =

When you open Oliver POS the first time you’ll be able to process the following types of payment methods by default:
* Cash
* Card
* Other

While this may be very basic, for many of our users this works perfectly as their everyday setup. This setup is particularly good when you have an external payment processing terminal and you’re simply looking for a record of sales.

For folks looking for integrated payment processing, we’ve partnered with some of the largest processors to allow our customers to implement more advanced checkout processes. To find out more about integrated payments and whether your terminal works with Oliver POS, please contact support@oliverpos.com.

= Can I print receipts with Oliver POS? =

Yes!

For folks using either the [Oliver Pro](https://hubs.ly/H0lM2CS0) or the [Oliver Mini](https://hubs.ly/H0lM2CS0), there is an integrated receipt printer in the terminal that automatically prints following checkout.

For other Point of Sale setups, as long as you have a connected printer it will be possible to print a receipt following a transaction. We have tested many printers with Oliver POS including the following types:
* Thermal receipt printers
* Inkjet printers
* Laser printers

If you have a specific printer that you need Oliver POS to integrate with, please let us know by emailing support@oliverpos.com

= Does Oliver POS Support Third Party Receipt Printers? =

Yes!

Oliver POS has been tested with many Third Party Printers. If you’ve got a specific printer you need us to integrate with, please contact support@oliverpos.com.

= Can I connect Oliver POS to a cash drawer? =

Yes**

The Oliver Pro and Mini are fully compatible with most cash drawers with standard connections (RJ45).

** For people not using one of the Oliver POS point of sale terminals, Oliver POS is compatible with cash drawers when combined with a connected thermal receipt printer. 

= Does Oliver POS work without WooCommerce? =

Better question: Why would you want to use anything but WooCommerce?

But more seriously, no, we currently only support the e-commerce platform. This is because we’ve built Oliver POS to integrate deeply into your WooCommerce shop, letting us provide you with a fast and accurate point of sale experience.

= All my products have barcodes. Will that work with Oliver POS? =

Yes!

As long as you have a barcode scanner and your products have a valid barcode reference in your WooCommerce shop, we can add products using their barcode.

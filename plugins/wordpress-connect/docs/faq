Below are asnswers to most common questions. If you have a question which is not answered here, please click on the <a title="WordPress Connect Support" rel="nofollow" href="http://wordpress.org/tags/wordpress-connect" target="_blank">Support link</a> and ask your question on the <a title="WordPress Connect Support" rel="nofollow" href="http://wordpress.org/tags/wordpress-connect" target="_blank">support forums</a>. I monitor those and will try to answer as soon as possible.
<h2><span id="how-does-it-work" class="mw-headline">How does it work</span></h2>
Using Wordpress Connect is very easy. Simply install and activate the plugin. The default settings will ensure that you can start benefiting from the features of Wordpress Connect right away. By default, Like Buttons will appear at the top of all posts and pages (just before the content) and Comments will appear at the bottom of your posts and pages (right after the content). All widgets are pre-configured with Facebook default values and are available from the Widgets Menu for an immediately use.
<h2><span id="previous-settings" class="mw-headline">I have upgraded to 2.0 and some/all of my previous settings are gone</span></h2>
Version 2.0 of WordPress connect offers greatly extended functionality, more features and more control over the social plugins. Unfortunately, as a direct consequence, a few settings from previous version(s) are incompatible and will need to be entered as again via the settings pages.

Furthermore, Facebook has rolled out many new features in March 2011 and consequently the format and xfbml markup of some of their social plugins has changed. New options on WordPress Connect setting pages reflect these changes, but unfortunately, it was not possible to keep every single setting from previous versions.

If you notice any unexpected behavior, please double check the values set on the WordPress Connect settings (available through your administratior dashboard). Additionally, please consult the <a title="WordPress Connect Documentation" rel="nofollow" href="http://wp-connect.tomasvorobjov.com/docs/" target="_blank">documentation page</a>.
<h2><span id="comments-moderation-access" class="mw-headline">Cannot access comments moderation</span></h2>
After adding the comments plugin to your blog and creating a new <a title="Facebook Application" rel="nofollow" href="http://developers.facebook.com/setup/" target="_blank">Facebook Application</a> clicking on "Settings" on the comments box displays the following error
<blockquote>Cannot edit global settings or moderation mode without fb:app_id</blockquote>
To solve this problem, you will need to add the domain of your blog to the Facebook Application settings:
<ol>
	<li>Go to <a title="My Apps on Facebook" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.facebook.com/developers/apps.php" target="_blank">My Apps</a></li>
	<li>Select the application your created for your blog/site (from the list of applications on the left side - <a title="Domain Settings (pt. 1)" href="#figure-1">Fig. 1</a></li>
	<li>Click on 'Edit Settings' in the list of links on the right side (next to application details) - <a title="Domain Settings (pt. 2)" href="#figure-2">Fig. 2</a></li>
	<li>Click on 'Web Site' (the second link from the top) - <a title="Domain Settings (pt. 3)" href="#figure-3">Fig. 3</a></li>
	<li>Fill in the 'Site Domain' field. If your blog is at http://www.myblog.com enter just 'myblog.com' - <a title="Domain Settings (pt. 4)" href="#figure-4">Fig. 4</a></li>
	<li>After clicking on 'Save Changes' and reloading the page with the comments on it, you should be able to access the moderation settings.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span id="what-is-application-id" class="mw-headline">What is the Application ID for?</span></h2>
The Facebook Javascript API require a unique application ID to work. A new ID can easiliy be created by registering your site/blog at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://developers.facebook.com/setup/" target="_blank">http://developers.facebook.com/setup/</a>.
<h2><span id="position-comments-like-button" class="mw-headline">How do I change the position of the Like Button/Comments?</span></h2>
The default position of the Like Button and Comments can be changed from the WP Connect options pages accessible through the dashboard. If you would like to change the position of the Like Button of Comments in a particular post or page, simply go to edit the post/page and select the new position from the Like Button and Comments position drop-downs (or the right-hand side, in the "Wordpress Connect" module).

For more details about customizing the position and the settings of individual Like Buttons and Comments see the <a title="WordPress Connect Documentation" rel="nofollow" href="http://wp-connect.tomasvorobjov.com/docs/" target="_blank">plugin's documentation</a> and <a title="WordPress Connect FAQ" rel="nofollow" href="http://wp-connect.tomasvorobjov.com/faq/" target="_blank">FAQ pages</a>.
<h2><span id="does-it-work-with-caching" class="mw-headline">Do the widgets work with WP Super Cache and other caching plugins?</span></h2>
Yes, the content in all widgets will update every time a user visits your site, even if the page (in which the widgets are embedded) remains unchanged. This is because Facebook delivers content to widgets either via asynchronous Javascript calls (xfbml), i.e. content is requested after every page load.
<h2><span id="widget-get-cut-off" class="mw-headline">The widgets I place in my sidebar are cut-off</span></h2>
Some Facebook Social Plugins have a minimum width below which they will not resize any further (but the will rather get cut-off). For example, the comments box needs to be at least 400px wide. If the container into which you are placing the widget is not wide enough, the content of the widget will not display properly. The usual sidebar that comes with most themes is too narrow for widgets such as the comments box. The only solution is to place the widget into a widget area that is wide enough, such as the 'Footer Widget Area' of the defeault twenty ten theme.
<h2><span id="problems-with-my-theme" class="mw-headline">The plugin doesn't work in my favorite theme</span></h2>
If the plugin doesn't work in one theme but does in others, the most likely reason is that the theme itself doesn't implement Wordpress hooks properly. For everything to work correctly, the plugin needs to add code into the html head tag (wordpress header) and the footer of the blog pages. It uses wordpress hooks (<code>add_action</code> and <code>add_filter</code>) for this purpose. If the theme author has not included the common wordpress hooks into the theme, required code cannot be added into the pages.

You should contact the theme author and ask him/her to implement the <code>wp_head</code> and <code>wp_footer</code> action calls correctly.
<h2><span id="dont-see-changes" class="mw-headline">I updated the plugin to the latest version but don't see the changes</span></h2>
If you are using any caching solution, such as WP Cache or WP Supercache, you'll need to reset the cache, i.e. to delete the cached pages. This is necessary so that the xfbml markup values can be updated.

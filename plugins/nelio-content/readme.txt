== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need Nelio Content? =

If you publish content with WordPress, Nelio Content will save you work organizing everything in a more efficient way thanks to the integrated editorial calendar. In addition, you can promote your posts on social networks effortlessly and without leaving WordPress.

= What are Social Automations? =

Social Automations is the most powerful feature included in Nelio Content. After writing a new post, Nelio Content will automatically analyze its copy and extract the most relevant sentences to generate a set of messages that will be shared on your social media when the post is published and afterwards. This feature is way more powerful than basic Social Templates, because the generated messages are crafted using the unique content of the post being shared. Moreover, Nelio Content is even capable of mentioning other Twitter users in your tweets to maximize the chances of being retweeted and, therefore, reaching a broader audience.

= I‚Äôve Connected my Social Profiles but Nelio Content Doesn‚Äôt Share Any Messages. Why? =

First of all, [make sure you‚Äôve enabled Social Automations on one or more social accounts](https://neliosoftware.com/content/help/publication-and-reshare-automations/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-content). Then, after you‚Äôve written a new post, scroll down to the Social Media box and click on the _Create Social Messages Automatically_ button. This will generate a marketing timeline to promote your post on your social accounts when the post is published and afterwards. If you don‚Äôt create those messages, Nelio Content won‚Äôt publish anything. This solution allows you to review the content that will be automatically shared before it actually happens.

Keep in mind automations are only available in Nelio Content Premium. If you‚Äôre using the free version of Nelio Content, only one message per profile and post will be shared upon post‚Äôs publication.

= Is Nelio Content a paid plugin? =

No. Nelio Content can be used completely for free using the version available at WordPress.org. However, if you want to unlock its full potential, you‚Äôll need to purchase a premium plan.

= What‚Äôs included in the free version of Nelio Content? =

The free version of Nelio Content includes the following features:

* 1 social profile per network
* Compatibility with Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Telegram, Tumblr, Google My Business, Pinterest, TikTok, and Reddit
* Manual creation and scheduling of social messages to share your blog content upon its publication
* Fully-fledged editorial calendar

* and more!

= Can I change my plan later? =

Sure, you can do it whenever you want. And if you have some specific needs that none of our plans satisfy, just let us know and we‚Äôll be happy to help you!

= Can I cancel my subscription at any time? =

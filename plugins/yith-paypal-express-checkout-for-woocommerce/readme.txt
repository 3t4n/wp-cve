Make payments immediate with PayPal Express Checkout and forget about customers’ complaints about pending orders.

== Description ==

Have you ever found yourself overwhelmed with customers complaints about PayPal payments that have not been processed immediately? Or complaints about orders paid inadvertently with e-check? Well, it’s routine issues that can happen, but now **PayPal has made a new payment gateway available, a more performing and immediate one**. Thanks to a one-to-one communication to the servers, the order is processed on the very moment it’s placed and the transaction is immediate.

**Forget about pending orders waiting for the IPN that has not been sent yet**. And forget about orders that can be completed after days because paid with e-check if you enable the dedicated option requiring only instant payments.

Last but not least, thanks to this new payment gateway, PayPal gives you also the possibility to choose among instant payments or **authorize-mode** ones. If you choose the latter, the payment is authorized but the transaction is made only when you are ready to process the order.

An advanced tool and the security granted by PayPal with a totally FREE plugin!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? =
Yes, this plugin is 100% free.

= What does the Lazy Load Clarity Plugin actually do? =
If there is no user activity, we will delay the clarity script for 5 seconds. If the script detects the user scrolling or any mouse activity, the script will be placed immediately.

= Why you need this plugin? =
If you are using traditional clarity plugin to install your clarity script or place the clarity script directly to your website. You may notice a sharp drop in your WordPress site page speed score especially for Core Web Vitals.

In this plugin, we use a combination technique of both delayed loading and lazy load of the Microsoft Clarity script. When you use our plugin to place Microsoft Clarity script, it will not affect your page speed score.

= Will this plugin speed up my website? =
Technically, this plugin doesn't speed up your website. If your website has a score of 80 (Core Web Vitals) before placing the clarity script, after using our plugin. The score will remain the same (80).

But if you place the code directly copied from official website without using this plugin. You may notice, your website core web vitals score might drop a bit. Our plugin can help you avoid a drop in your core Web Vitals score.

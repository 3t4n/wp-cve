== Description ==

== All Bootstrap Blocks is 100% free ==

Introducing All Bootstrap Blocks. The fastest and most simple way to create fully responsive Bootstrap 5 layouts directly in the WordPress editor with a live preview! Plus we've included blocks for all of the Bootstrap components, including modals, accordions, cards and much more.

It's time for **[All Bootstrap Blocks](https://areoi.io/all-bootstrap-blocks/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme)**.

== Quick and easy Bootstrap customisation ==

All Bootstrap Blocks automatically includes both the Bootstrap CSS and JS, and provides a simple to use interface for managing all of your Bootstrap settings... without coding. Easily setup your colours, fonts, spacing and everything else. If you want more control over Bootstrap you can simply turn this feature off and include your own Bootstrap files.

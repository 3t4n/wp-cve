Control the visibility of each widget easily based on date, time and weekday.

== Description ==

Widget Visibility Time Scheduler displays and hides widgets based on desired date, time and weekday automatically.

Try it out on your free demo site https://demo.tastewp.com/widget-visibility-time-scheduler

The plugin is available in English, Spanish (Español), German (Deutsch), Brazilian Portuguese (Português do Brasil), Persian (Farsi), Hungarian (Magyar), Arabic (العربية), Polish (Polski) and Catalan (Català). It does not collect any personal data, so it is ready for EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.

NOTE: Widget Visibility Time Scheduler is currently NOT compatible with WordPress 5.8 introduced block-based widgets editor. If you have already updated to WordPress 5.8, or you want to do this, but you want to still use Widget Visibility Time Scheduler you need to switch back to the classic widget editor. For this we provided a new setting page where you can do this.
If you don't want to do this, Widget Visibility Time Scheduler is not the right plugin for you.

== Compatibility with block based widgets ==

With WordPress 5.8 the block based widgets were introduced. The technique behind these new widget concept is more complex. One of the changes is, the widgets are now using API call to display.
Extensive programming is required to prepare Widget Visibility Time Scheduler for this new feature. Nothing I could do in the short time I was able to test this feature.
Even so, Widget Visibility Time Scheduler works with WordPress 5.8 and higher. The only adjustment you need to make is to turn off the block-based widgets for a while.
As known from the Gutenberg block editor, there is also a plug-in to deactivate the block-based widgets.

Please download, install and activate [Classic Widgets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/) from wordpress.org and switch back to the usual widget area.

I'm working hard to make Widget Visibility Time Scheduler compatible for the block based widgets. It takes some time to provide a stable and error-free code base.
Stay tuned for a brand-new version in the near future. And thank you for your understanding.

= Show and hide widgets within a desired period and at given weekdays =

The Widget Visibility Time Scheduler enables you to set the period and weekdays of the visibility of each widget easily. You can set to show or to hide the widget during schedule. It is available in english, german, spanish, brazilian portuguese, persian, hungarian and arabic language.

= Daytime version available in the Pro version =

If you want to schedule the visibility based on the daytime of each weekday [go to the Pro version of the plugin](https://www.kybernetik-services.com/shop/wordpress/plugin/widget-visibility-time-scheduler-pro/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=widget-visibility-time-scheduler&utm_content=update-notice-readme).

= Automatic cache clearing available in the Pro version =

Doesn't the activated cache react when a widget is hidden or displayed by the scheduler? So if you want the cache to empty/clear/purge/flush automatically, the Pro version is the right tool for you.

Widget Visibility Time Scheduler Pro clears the cache of the following plugins automatically:

* Autoptimize
* Cache Enabler
* Hummingbird
* W3 Total Cache
* WP Fastest Cache
* WP Optimize
* WP Super Cache

[Go to the Pro version of the plugin](https://www.kybernetik-services.com/shop/wordpress/plugin/widget-visibility-time-scheduler-pro/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=widget-visibility-time-scheduler&utm_content=update-notice-readme).

= Compatibility with Jetpack =

This plugin works perfectly with Jetpack's "Widget Visibility" module. Both plugins enhance each other to give you great control about when and where to display which widget on your website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use? =

1. Go to the Widget page in the WordPress backend. Every widget is enhanced by easy-to-use fields for time data.
2. Set comfortably the start point of time, the end point of time and the weekdays when to display or to hide the widget. With the "unlimited" option the widget is displayed "forever" in the future. If you want to hide the widget during schedule, activate the Hide option.
3. After you have defined the time data just save the widget settings. Done!

= Is there an option page? =

No. That is not necessary. You set the visibility in each widget on the Widgets' page in the backend.

= Do the scheduler settings effect cached pages? =

No. This plugin has no site effects to cache plugins. So it can happen that a cached page shows a widget although the scheduler settings says to hide it, and vice versa.

It is up to your cache settings how the visibility of a widget is considered. Maybe it is helpful to empty the cache automatically once a day.

= How can I set the daytime for each weekday? =

This is a feature which comes with the Pro version. The Pro version is identical with the free plugin version, enhanced with the ability to schedule the visibility based on the time of each weekday. The Pro version is also available in german, spanish, brazilian portuguese, persian, hungarian and arabic. Please contact the author at support@kybernetik.com.de for more information about the Pro version.

= Does remove the plugin delete the settings in the database? =

Up to now: no. But you can remove the settings in the database easily with two possibilities:

* Either deactivate (uncheck) the visibility time scheduler in each widget and save the widget settings.
* Or remove the widget out of the widget area.

= Does the plugin works with Jetpack's Widget Visibility module? =

Yes. Both plugins work together perfectly and enhance each other to give you great control about when and where to display which widget.

= Why is the highest year number 2037? =

Most servers are 32-bit systems, either the hardware or the software WordPress uses: Apache, PHP, MySQL. The technical maximum time a 32-bit system can handle is 03:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038. If a user would type in a date after 19 January 2038 a strange behaviour would occur.

So to have safe values I have set deliberately the maximum valid year value to 2037. That allowed the latest point of time at 23:59:00 on December 31, 2037. And that avoids a more complicated, unsafe check for a date like “January 19, 2039 03:14:07″.

You can find a detailed and understandable explanation at [Wikipedia: Year 2038 problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem). That text also explains why the lowest year number is 1970.

= Where is the *.pot file for translating the plugin in any language? =

The plugin is ready for right-to-left languages like Arabic or Hebrew.

Further translations are welcome. If you want to give in your translation please leave a notice in the [plugin's support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/widget-visibility-time-scheduler). A translation of the plugin in your language would be great! 

All texts of the plugin are in the *.pot file. You would find the *.pot file in the 'languages' directory of this plugin. If you would send the *.po file to me I would include it in the next release of the plugin.

By using this official SMTP plugin, you will:
* Improve your email deliverability
* Protect your domain reputation
* Learn more about your recipients

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why use MailerSend rather than WordPress to send emails? =
* Most WordPress hosting services use the PHP mail() function to send emails. But different email configurations between web hosts mean that they may not be optimized for deliverability.
* MailerSend takes care of email delivery so your emails reach your customers safely. Plus, you get a dashboard that shows you important data about your emails and how their performance can be improved.
* For more information, read this blog article about why WordPress and WooCommerce [might not send your emails](https://www.mailersend.com/blog/woocommerce-not-sending-emails) every time.

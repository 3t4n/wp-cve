**Build your mailing lists**

Is your email list not growing fast enough? Would you like to grow your list faster? 

Email marketing opens up a massive audience for the brand, increase its reach beyond social media. It’s the most profitable online marketing method. But hey, since you are here, you probably already know that.

And you might also know how important length of an email list is. Simply put, more names on the list means your brand has a bigger reach. Building a sizeable email list quickly, however, is not an easy marketing problem to solve. 

With EngageBay forms, you can create stunning contact and subscription forms to easily grow your email list.  

**Segment your mailing lists**

Using ready to use fields and custom fields, capture as much information as you can on your leads. With all these details, you can segment your email lists more effectively and target your customers more precisely improving the conversions dramatically.

Better segmentation simply means a higher degree of personalization which translates to more email opens and a higher click-through rate (CTR). Higher CTR, in turn, drives more traffic and potentially higher sales.

> We sell online courses. Using EngageBay forms, we collected customer's interests in courses we offer. We then created personalized emails for each course. This has skyrocketed our sales and engagement. <br>
> Raj G - Co-founder of a portal offering online courses

**Confirm email subscriptions for a healthy email list**

One of the most important stats to measure the success of your email list is conversion rate. When a customer accidentally signs up for your email list, it increases the list size but the contact remains unengaged.  

With EngageBay forms, you can choose to send an opt-in confirmation email to ensure the customer is truly interested. 

**Follow up with customers after successful signup**

After you have successfully collected the customer details, show them a customized thank you message or send them elsewhere to a web page. Setup an automatic welcome email to be sent for better engagement.

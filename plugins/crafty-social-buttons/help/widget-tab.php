<p><strong>Widget</strong></p>

<p>To include <em>Share Buttons</em> or <em>Link Buttons</em> in any widget area (e.g. header, sidebar, footer), you can use the <strong>Crafty Social Buttons</strong> Widget available on
		the <a href="widgets.php">widget screen</a>.</p>
        
<p>This can be added to any widget region your theme provides by dragging and dropping.  You choose whether you want it to display <em>Share Buttons</em> or <em>Link Buttons</em> (although it is really most useful for including the <em>Link Buttons</em>), and the buttons will be output using the settings you have configured on this page.</p>

<p>You can include the widget more than once, for instance, you can include Link buttons in both the header and footer of your page.</p>

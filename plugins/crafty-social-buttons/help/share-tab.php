<p><strong>Share Buttons</strong></p>

<p>The <em>Share Buttons</em> will link to your profile on each of the selected social media services. This is what all the options do:</p>
		
<dl>
<dt>Image Set</dt>
<dd>Choose which icons you would like displayed on your site.   When you choose a different value, you should see the icons below change so you know what they will look like.</dd>

<dt>Image Size</dt>
<dd>Make the buttons bigger or smaller, between 24px and 64px.</dd>

<dt>Caption</dt>
<dd>This text displays just before the icons.  If there's enough room, it will be to the left, otherwise it will be just above the icons</dd>

<dt>Caption Position</dt>
<dd>Choose whether the icon is immediately to the left of the buttons (if there's enough room) or just above the icons</dd>

<dt>Show these services</dt>
<dd>Lets you choose which icons are displayed and in which order.  Just drag the icons to reorder them, and drag them between the selected and available boxes to include only the ones you want.<br/>
Note that there are a couple of icons you can choose that won't show up in the sharing buttons list. You can use the icons for Etsy and Craftsy to create <em>Link Buttons</em>, but there are currently no 'share via Etsy' or 'share on Craftsy' features available, so if you choose it as a Share Button, it won't be displayed</dd>

<dt>Position</dt>
<dd>Allows you to choose whether the icons are displayed directly above or below the post content (or both!)</dd>

<dt>Button Alignment</dt>
<dd>Buttons are aligned to the left by default. You can also center or right align the whole set of buttons.</dd>

<dt>Hover effect</dt>
<dd>Change the opacity of the buttons so they appear to either dim on hover or brighten on hover.  This probably won't look good if your buttons are on a patterned background, as it might show through the buttons when it is dimmed.</dd>

<dt>Float Share Buttons</dt>
<dd>This pulls the buttons out of the content and makes them stick to the side of the page in a vertical column.</dd>

<dt>Float Alignment</dt>
<dd>Which side of the page the floating buttons should stick to.</dd>

<dt>Float Height</dt>
<dd>How far down the page the buttons should be.</dd>

<dt>Show on Posts</dt>
<dd>If this is selected, the icons will be automatically added to the individual page for each post.</dd>

<dt>Show on Home Page</dt>
<dd>Allows the icons to be added to the posts on the home page too.  Depending on your theme, this may be too much clutter.</dd>

<dt>Show on Category Pages</dt>
<dd>If this is selected, the icons will be added to each post on category listing pages</dd>

<dt>Show on Archive Pages</dt>
<dd>If this is selected, the icons will be added to each post on time based archives pages</dd>

<dt>Show on Pages</dt>
<dd>If this is selected, the icons will be added to pages</dd>

<dt>Show on Static Front Page</dt>
<dd>If you have a static front page, this will add share buttons to it.  The buttons will share your home page url.</dd>
 
<dt>Open in</dt>
<dd>Controls how the share links operate.  Opening a popup or a new window is recommended. Once the user has finished and closes it, they will be back at your site.</dd>

<dt>Email text</dt>	 
<dd>The default text that will be added to the email when someone shares using the email button.  It's just a suggestion - they are free to edit before they click send.</dd>

<dt>Twitter text</dt>
<dd>The default text that will be populated in their tweet when someone shares using the twitter button.  Again, it just gives them this text as a starter - they are free to edit before they actually tweet it.</dd>

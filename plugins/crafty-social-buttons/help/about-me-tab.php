<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p>Made with love by <a href="http://sarahhenderson.nz">Sarah Henderson</a>,
	a freelance web developer from New Zealand.</p>
<p>I learned to crochet and thought of starting up a crochet related blog to show
	off my new creations.  I got a bit sidetracked making pretty icons and WordPress plugins
	and thought that others in the crafty community might want to use them too.</p>
<p>I never did get around to blogging about crochet!</p>

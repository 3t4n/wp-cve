Notify subscribers automatically when products are restocked. Supports Simple, Variable, Grouped, and Subscription types.

== Description ==

[<strong>Live Demo</strong>](https://demo.codewoogeek.online/back-in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce/)

<strong>Back In Stock Notifier</strong> is a WooCommerce Waitlist Pro Plugin that displays the Email Subscription form on the frontend when a product is Out of Stock. When a Product comes Back in Stock, this plugin notifies the subscribers by email in the background process. Many of the existing plugins loop through the subscribers to send mail, so there is a high chance of failure or timeouts. This plugin is designed to overcome this problem by sending emails using a background process, ensuring it does not fail until the completion of the loop, thus converting your subscribers into customers.

== Supported Product Types of WooCommerce == 
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Variable</li>
<li>Grouped</li>
<li>Simple Subscription (From WooCommerce)</li>
<li>Variable Subscription (From WooCommerce)</li>
<li>Product Bundle (From WooCommerce)</li>
</ul>

We designed this product to manage subscribers in one place. What happens if we send instock mail to 10,000+ subscribers? The server will likely crash or encounter timeout issues, sometimes resulting in duplicate emails being sent to subscribers.

We designed this plugin to overcome this situation by sending emails in the background, ensuring emails are sent to the respective users without any issues.

[<strong>WPML - Back In Stock Notifier for WooCommerce | WooCommerce Waitlist Pro - $10.00</strong>](https://codewoogeek.online/shop/back-in-stock-notifier/wpml/)

This Addon is based on WPML, for sending an email to your subscribed users based on their language, which has more potential than sending it in the site language. If you are already using WPML, then you already know the advantages. After activation, this plugin will register <strong>admin_texts_cwginstocksettings </strong>for string translation. Then we pick the subscriber's current language, check the translated text available for that language, and finally, we mail it to the corresponding user. This Addon is necessary when you want to make use of WPML.

If you subscribed wrongly to the product/someone wrongly subscribed to the product without your notice, using this addon, that user can unsubscribe from the list at any time.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 7.0 or greater
* MySQL 5.6 or greater
* WooCommerce 3.0+
* WordPress 4.7+

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option, as WordPress handles the file transfers itself, and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Back In Stock Notifier, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click Add New.

In the search field, type “Back In Stock Notifier” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin with author codewoogeek, you can view details about it, such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now.”

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Difference between this plugin and other similar plugins? =
Actually, we sync and send the email to your subscribers in a background process, so server crashes or timeouts are ignored when using our plugin. This ensures a 99.99% success rate for sent emails.
= How to import subscribers' data to my new site? =
You can do this by using the native way of WordPress. Go to Admin Dashboard -> Tools -> Export -> Subscribers -> Download Export File (xml). Later, you can import that data into your new site by visiting Admin Dashboard -> Tools -> Import -> Upload Downloaded XML file and Finish Import. Now you've successfully migrated subscribers' data.
= Something went wrong error upon subscription and how to get rid of such error?  =
Actually,
We use one layer of security for our ajax requests, which is WP Nonce. However, due to the caching mechanism of third-party plugins or hosting, this security nonce can also get cached. This can cause the error "something went wrong, please try again after some time." In some cases, setting the cache timeout in the plugin settings can reduce this kind of issue.

From version 2.0, we added different techniques to avoid the "Something Went Wrong" error. If your site has encountered such issues, we suggest you try the following steps to get rid of the error:

1. Go to Admin Dashboard -> Instock Notifier -> Settings -> Troubleshoot Settings Section -> Frontend Subscribe Form Submission via. It has two options: WordPress AJAX (default) and WordPress REST API Route. Try changing that option to WordPress REST API Route and check it out (purge your cache and check it out).

2. If the above steps are not helpful, then try the another method, which is Google reCAPTCHA v3 (Invisible Recaptcha). For this, you need the Site Key and Secret Key of v3. Go to Admin Dashboard -> Instock Notifier -> Settings -> Google reCAPTCHA Settings -> Enable Google reCAPTCHA and Choose Version -> V3, followed by Site Key and Secret Key (both fields are required to function properly).

3. If v3 does not help, try v2 of Google reCAPTCHA.

= How to override/create a custom template for the front-end subscribe form? =

1. Create a folder inside your current theme with the name "back-in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce." For example: wordpress -> wp-content -> themes -> storefront/(your theme) -> back-in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce.

2. Go to our plugin folder, then inside, find the "templates" folder. (wordpress -> wp-content -> plugins -> back-in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce -> templates -> default-form.php)

3. Open the "templates" folder and copy the file with the name "default-form.php" from that folder.

4. Now, paste the copied file inside your theme under the folder with the name "back-in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce" (step 1).

5. That's all. Now, you've successfully loaded the template from your theme, and you can edit it however you want.

= I manage stock inventory in thirdparty inventory management will your plugin handle this? =

Not all site owners manage stock within the website; some of them manage their stock through third-party inventory management. The problem with our plugin is that Automatic Instock Email is not triggered/detected because some third-party software directly updates the stock in the database.

From v2.4, we methodologically implemented support for Third-party stock management to send our Automatic Instock Email. Do the following:

Go to Admin Dashboard -> Instock Notifier -> Settings -> Troubleshoot Section -> Enable this option if you have updated the stock from a third-party inventory plugin. Enable that checkbox option and save changes.

Now we check the product every five minutes to trigger our Automatic Instock Email when the stock status becomes "In Stock."

= How can I manually check for subscribers' email? =
Our plugin syncs with WordPress users who subscribe to our plugin. In some cases, an email id can be added without subscriptions (like cart abandonment, checkout page, etc.) by website owners. To check such emails, you can go to Admin Dashboard -> Users -> Add any data you want. For example, custom text.
= What to do when a product is in stock but subscribers didn't get emails? =
If your product is in stock and your subscribers didn't get emails, do the following:
  1. Go to Admin Dashboard -> Instock Notifier -> Settings.
  2. Go to the Troubleshoot Section.
  3. Set "Enable to send Instock Email after 'X' time when stock becomes Instock" to something like 5 minutes.
  4. Save Changes.
  
= Does your plugin support REST API? =
From Version 2.0, we added support for REST API, which allows you to create/update/get/delete subscribers. For this, you need Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.

<strong>How to generate Consumer key and Consumer Secret?</strong>
-------------------------------------------------
We designed our plugin to work on top of WooCommerce, so the credentials created from WooCommerce (consumer key and consumer secret) can also be used for our REST API Endpoint to perform different actions. Go to WooCommerce -> Advanced -> REST API -> Create Keys (with read/write permissions).

<strong>What endpoints are provided by your plugin?</strong>
-------------------------------------------------
We created documentation for the REST API, which you can check here [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15423262/TzJrDfTe](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15423262/TzJrDfTe)

= How to contact your support? =

You can contact us via the support Forum of WordPress or by creating a support ticket from our site [https://codewoogeek.online/](https://codewoogeek.online/)

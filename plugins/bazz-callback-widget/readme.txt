== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do not receive an email from the widget =

1. Check if you entered the email address correctly in the plugin settings.
2. If, when you click on "Waiting for a call", the cursor takes the form of an expectation and nothing happens - it means an error in the plugin code. It can be found in the PHP logs and sent to the author for the study.
3. If upon clicking the letter is sent (the result text is displayed), but do not come to the mail, check the logs of the mail server. The message may be stuck due to incorrect mail server settings or due to the blocked sending option. On some hosting sites, the mail server works in a limited mode or specifically filters notifications from WordPress. In this case, setting up sending messages through an external SMTP server (for example gmail) can help you. The easiest way to configure this is with the appropriate plugin (see google).
4. Finally, check your spam folder for your mail :-).

= How to attach google/yandex targets? =

The plugin has a custom event "bazzSuccessSubmit" triggered on success submitting the form. So you can listen to this event and handle it then it triggered.
For example to follow yandex targets put on you page this code:
(replace ID and name of target to yours)
```
document.addEventListener( 'bazzSuccessSubmit', function( event ) {
	ym(111222333, 'reachGoal', 'NameOfTarget');
}, false );
```

## Synopsis

This is an easy way to add a quick pre-submission confirmation page to your forms where users can preview their entered data before it is submitted. Gravity Forms does not provide any way to do this by default; however, with this plugin and a few simple form configuration instructions, you’ll have pre-submission confirmations working like magic!

### Features

* Adds a quick pre-submission confirmation page to Gravity Forms.
* No configurations; Just Plugin & Play!

## Installation
1. Upload `GF-Confirmation` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin from Admin > Plugins menu.
3. Add a page at the end of the form for the pre-submission confirmation. You can do this using the Page Break field type.
3. Add an HTML field from the “Standard Fields” section.
4. THe easiest way is to add {all_fields} to this section. But if you need more customizatios, go ahead and select the HTML field for editing. The “Content” setting of this field now supports all merge tags like {Name (First):4}, {Question:5}.
6. Update the Gravity form.

== Description ==

This plugin will show the page URL on Pages in WP Dashboard > All Pages

This will help you with SEO Keyword Page Mapping.

If you go to 'Pages' > 'All Pages', you will see a URL column showing the actual URL of 
the page.

This helps with SEO. It can be done via a script in the functions.php file BUT every time you do a WP version update it overwrites the script.

Add this lightweight plugin and page mapping is a breeze.

Recapture is the easiest and most effective way to recover abandoned carts and do email marketing for your WooCommerce site.  We also support [Easy Digital Downloads abandoned cart recovery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/recapture-for-edd/) as well!

**NOTE:**
> **Requires: WooCommerce 3.0** or newer and a free Recapture account

Recapture helps your store increase sales.  This plugin connects Recapture to WooCommerce to send triggered emails to your customers to recover abandoned carts for WooCommerce, win back old customers, or request reviews.

= ** Recapture has a long history of success with Abandoned Carts ** =

_Recapture has already helped merchants generate **over $186,000,000** in additional revenue since 2015._  We're recovering hundreds of thousands a week for stores like yours.

Recapture's [abandoned cart recovery for WooCommerce](https://recapture.io/abandoned-carts-woocommerce) helps your ecommerce store **recover lost revenue** from abandoned carts for WooCommerce.  Recapture tracks when carts are abandoned on your store, then lets you send recovery emails to encourage the customers who abandoned these carts to complete the purchase.

You can set up as many campaigns and recovery emails as you'd like, and customize the text and design of every email sent.

Recapture has best-in-class email capture capabilities--using email popups, or our new "Add to Cart" email popup, where users enter an email before they add the item to the cart, ensuring easier recovery.

And now, Recapture support SMS notifications for order updates and abandoned cart recovery.

= ** Emails are Ready-to-go on Install, but easily customized ** =

_You don't need to spend a lot of time setting up Recapture before you can benefit from it._  

Recapture's emails are setup using best practices out-of-the-box so you can turn them on immediately.  Or you can change them using our friendly drag and drop based editor, or even completely customize the content using full HTML.  The choice is yours!

Campaigns come configured with ideal timings, but you're free to set them as you'd like (e.g., send 3 recovery emails per abandoned cart, or a series of 4 emails in a winback campaign), customize their send timing, and use a drag-and-drop editor to change the content.  **Very friendly for non-technical users.**  Setting up recovery for abandoned carts on WooCommerce has never been easier.

= ** Winbacks, Review Reminders, and Email Collectors, oh my! ** =

_Installing Recapture gives you the features of 4 separate plugins with less hassle_  

Besides **abandoned carts for WooCommerce**, we support **email popups** to encourage list building, we support **review reminder emails** to get customers to provide a review after purchase (social proof increases sales!), and **winback emails** to encourage customers to be repeat buyers.  All of these increase your average order value, making your store more profitable.

And now, broadcast emails and SMS are supported too.

= ** Won't drag your site down ** =

_Average load time for Recapture's JavaScript library is between 30-600 milliseconds, so your site won't suffer_

Tracking for orders and carts is done and stored in Recapture, not your site's database.  We send emails from our robust cloud infrastructure using best practices (SPF, DKIM, etc) to ensure maximum delivery and open rates.  This means your site **stays FAST** for buyers while we track analytics and carts for you, allowing you see everything you need in a click or two.

Recapture is backed by a team with a long history of ecommerce success.  Recapture Abandoned Carts for WooCommerce works on any store and scales automatically with our AWS load-balanced, multi-server infrastructure.  We handle stores of all sizes.  No need to worry as you grow!

= When do you consider a cart "abandoned" and how do you get emails from my customers? =

A cart is considered abandoned if a customer has added items to the cart, but has not checked out or shown any cart activity for at least 30 minutes.  At this point, Recapture starts the timers for your recovery emails.

= How do you get emails from my customers? =

Recapture can get an email in a few different ways--First, any logged in customer who abandons a cart will receive recovery emails because of their WP profile.  Any guest customer who has entered a full, valid email address somewhere in the site (e.g.  email popup, our Add to Cart popup, even OTHER plugins that collect emails--Recapture can track that, easily) will receive recovery emails too.  Our success here comes from a few secrets in our JavaScript library that makes Recapture so powerful.

= Can I include unique coupon codes in my emails? =

Yep! Recapture can find and include WooCommerce coupon codes in your automated emails.  This gives you a proven and powerful means of increasing conversion rates and generating more orders!

Yes.  As of July 2021, Recapture can now send broadcast campaigns to promote your sales, send newsletters and more.

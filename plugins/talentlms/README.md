### About The Project

[TalentLMS](http://www.talentlms.com/ "TalentLMS super-easy, cloud-based learning platform") is a cloud-based, lean LMS with an emphasis on usability and easy course creation. With TalentLMS we wanted to create a better learning experience in every way that actually matters â€“ and we are excited about this new offering. The product focuses on small but growing organizations. There are a number of obstacles that prohibit small organizations from using elearning. To be productive, small businesses need a number of tools and several related services such as setup and maintenance, course creation and the support of end-users. All these require ample time, resources and money. It comes as no surprise that most small organizations find elearning a non-viable pursuit and prefer on-job or informal training methods.

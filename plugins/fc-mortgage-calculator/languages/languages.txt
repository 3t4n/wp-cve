If you are a blogger that blogs in a language other than English and if you would like to have a number of very high quality calculators for your website, then contact me at AccurateCalculators.com. I would be happy to consider providing my calculators to you for use on your site in exchange for you editing computer provided translations. This offer applies to all my calculators, not just the plugins.

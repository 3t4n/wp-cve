Automatic Copyright Year keeps your copyright year always up to date automatically.

== Description ==

Automatic Copyright Year seeks to solve a common problem: keeping your copyright year up-to-date.

It's a problem all of us had: on January 1st every year, we need to go through every one of our websites and update all the footers. And when we see other people's sites that, in the footer, say, "(c) 1998" then suddenly it's revealed how out-of-date the site is. 

With Automatic Copyright Year, this problem will never happen to you!

Instead of going through every site you have each year on the 1st of January and change the year manually, now it will all be done seamlessly for you. Just install the Automatic Copyright Year plugin and voila: your sites will always have an up-to-date copyright.

== Installation ==

The installation and use is very straightforward. You should:

1. Upload the folder `automatic-copyright-year` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add '&lt;span&gt;[wpsos_year]&lt;/span&gt;' (<span>[wpsos_year]</span>, surrounded by span tags) to a widget or to anywhere inside the html footer element. You can also use [wpsos_year] as a shortcode!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which options do you modify? =

As of version 1.0, there is no need to modify any options. The plugin will go through the content of your widgets and the html footer tag and replace <span>[wpsos_year]</span> with the current year number.

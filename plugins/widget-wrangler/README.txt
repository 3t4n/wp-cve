== Installation ==

1. Visit Plugins >> Add New on your site and search for "widget wrangler".  Download and activate the plugin.

= Automatic Theme Setup =

If you want to use a single Corral per WordPress sidebar (or are unsure what all this means), visit Widget Wrangler >> Settings >> Tools and click "Setup Theme".  This will automatically create one Corral for each WordPress Sidebar, and place the Corral Widget into each Sidebar.

= Manual Setup =

1. Add a new corral under the Widget Wrangler >> Corrals menu item
1. Corral Display: Add a Corral to your existing theme's sidebars by using the Widget Wrangler Corral widget in the Appearance >> Widgets area.
1. Begin adding widgets under the Widget Wrangler >> Add New menu
1. Set default widgets on the Widget Wrangler >> Presets >> Default page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a Corral =

A Corral is an arbitrary group of widgets.  WordPress calls them "sidebars", but they are not ultimately limited by that terminology.  You could have multiple Corrals appear within a single Sidebar if needed.

= Where does a widget's html come from? =

With the new "Theme compatibility" setting, it is possible for the widget's html to come from 2 places.
If Theme Compatibility is not enabled, then all the html for widgets come from Widget Wrangler's widget template (widget.php).
With Theme Compatibility enabled, the outer html for the widget comes from the registered sidebar's properties ($before_widget, $before_title, etc), while the inner content html comes from the widget template.

Be aware that on new Widget Wrangler installs, "Theme Compatibility" is enabled by default.

= How do I display a single widget within a Page's content? =

Widget Wrangler comes with built in shortcode support for each widget.  To show a single widget in a content area, use the shortcode pattern of [ww_widget id={post_id}].
ie. [ww_widget id=240] where 240 is the post_id of the widget.

= How do I find out a widget's post ID? =

A widget's post ID is displayed in the 'Options' panel when editing that widget.

= How do I display my widgets? =

The easiest way is to go to the standard Widget area under the Appearance admin menu item and drag the "Widget Wrangler - Corral" widget into the sidebar area where you want it, then select which Widget Wrangler corral should be shown from the widget options.
The other way requires you to edit your template files and find any instance of the dynamic_sidebar() function.  Replace these functions with ww_dynamic_sidebar('corral_slug').

= How can I control the widget's template (HTML)? =

In the widget-wrangler directory there is a file named 'templates/widget.php'.  Copy this file to your theme's root directory and rename it 'widget.php'.  You can edit the HTML in the file to have widgets defaultly appear as you want.
To template specific widgets, save a copy of templates/widget.php as widget-[widget ID].php in your theme directory. (eg. widget-121.php, where 121 is the widget's ID)

= Can I use existing WordPress widgets? =

Mostly. Widgets designed for WordPress 3+ are able to be used with the 'Copy WP Widget' option in the Widget Wrangler menu.  Widgets programmed for older versions of WordPress may not work.

= What does it mean to Copy/Clone a widget? =

When you Copy a WordPress widget, it creates a new widget post in the Widget Wrangler system with the settings for the original WordPress widget pre-filled.  A copied widget will contain the original widget form for the WP widget.

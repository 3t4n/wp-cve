<p><?=__('CF7 Smart Grid extension replaces the Contact Form 7 shortcodes with a more portable one.  Instead of using an ID, the Smart Grid uses the unique <em>cf7Key</em>, which is non other than the slug of the wpcf7_contact_form post, which remains fixed when you export/import your forms and port them to a new server.  Happy coding!','cf7-grid-layout')?></p>

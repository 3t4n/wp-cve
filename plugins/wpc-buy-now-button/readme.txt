= Lightning-fast Shopping Experience =

Buy Now buttons can be added at different levels of your store easily: storewide >> category level >> product level (short-code). Since version 2.0.1, users can select which product category(ies) has the Buy Now button enabled so certain product groups are excluded from the speed shopping.

What is special about the **WPC Buy Now Button for WooCommerce** plugin is that it can bring about a blazing-fast purchasing speed on your site at increasing levels: Hide default Add to Cart button >> Redirect to cart page >> Redirect to checkout page >> Open the Instant Checkout popup

- Hiding the default Add to Cart button, so customers can only choose to Buy Now
- Redirecting to the cart page after Buy Now encourages people to be put in a mood to purchase rather than just visiting or navigating without certain purchase interest
- Redirect to the checkout page after Buy Now will make visitors decide to close the deal and place their order faster. This will also reduce the cart abandonment rate
- Leaving no time for second thoughts using the Instant Checkout popup after Buy Now.

= Instant Checkout (PREMIUM) =

The Instant Checkout popup can be simply triggered when buyers press on the Buy Now so they can fill the address and payment details without even leaving the current page. This should be the most ideal action to be triggered by the Buy Now button as it not only reduces cart abandonment effectively but also improves the order placement.

With the Premium version, advanced settings are enabled so users can choose a position to display the Instant Checkout popup on the screen: left, right, center, top or bottom. Enabling the perfect-scrollbar effect will make the experience become smoother and smoother.

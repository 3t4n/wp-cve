This configuration will then be automatically reflected on the entire network. This is available for Google Authenticator, Duo Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Security Questions, LastPass, Authy, miniOrange methods, OTP over SMS, and OTP over Email.

== Multi factor authentication ( 2FA / MFA ) ==
You can configure multiple WordPress 2FA methods like google authenticator, OTP over Email, OTP over SMS, etc, and choose any one method from a list of configured methods to use as 2FA for your WordPress website. Multi-factor authentication is helpful for cases such as when you do not have your phone and cannot access your TOTP app for login. You can then use other MFA methods like OTP over Email to login.

Check all the features other than MFA ( 2FA ) here: [miniOrange Website](https://plugins.miniorange.com/2-factor-authentication-for-wordpress-wp-2fa#pricing).

= Why do you need to register for Multi-Factor authentication? =

Multi-Factor authentication uses miniOrange APIs to communicate between your WP website and miniOrange. To keep this communication secure, we ask you to register and assign API keys specific to your account. This way your account and users' calls can only be accessed by API keys assigned to you.
Adding to this, you can also use the same account on multiple applications and your users do not have to maintain multiple accounts on WordPress 2FA like Google Authenticator. Single code generated in Google Authenticator will be enough to login to all sites. With this, you can also achieve sync of two factor authentication across multiple sites. This helps to provide a secure WP 2FA cloud solution.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I gain access to my website if I get locked out using multi-factor authentication? =

You can obtain access to your website by one of the below options:

1. If you have an additional administrator account whose Two Factor (2FA) is not enabled yet, you can login with it.
2. If you had set up KBA questions earlier, you can use them as an alternate method to login to your website instead of 2FA.
3. Rename the plugin from FTP - this disables the Two-Factor (2FA/TFA) plugin and you will be able to login with your WordPress username and password.

### GETTING STARTED WITH CHAPORT

To start using Chaport Live Chat, you need to create an account. It is fast and free. No credit card required. Once your Chaport account is activated, you are ready to install the widget on your website. You will do it in no time with **WP Live Chat + Chatbots Plugin for WordPress – Chaport**.

Just after the installation, the live chat widget will be visible on your website and you’ll be ready to communicate with your visitors. In your account, configure the settings of your live chat – add operators, upload the photos, customize the widget, create auto-invitations, build chatbots and use all the other tools to provide a unique experience for your customers.

### USE ONE ACCOUNT FOR MULTIPLE WEBSITES

You can install the Chaport chat widget on as many sites as you wish on all of the plans including the free version. Handle all your live chats in one Chaport app. A website from which a live chat comes will be displayed in the Visitor Info section to the right of an open chat. You can keep the same design on all your pages and websites or customize your widget appearance for each URL individually.

### MANAGING THE ACCOUNT

You can assign roles to your operators and specify their functions. An operator can assume one of the two roles:

- **Operator** who can receive live chats, see other operators’ chats, and view reports.
- **Administrator** who can do everything an “Operator” can, and besides that, configure the account settings (customize the widget appearance, add other operators, etc.)

A user who first registered a Chaport account automatically becomes an “Administrator” and “Account Owner.” This operator can’t be deleted, and their role always remains the same. The account owner can choose a pricing plan and pay for the account.

### LIVE CHAT & CHATBOTS

Boost the productivity of your website using Live Chat + Chatbots combination. Interact with your site visitors in real time via live chats and provide 24/7 support using chatbots.

The Chaport team has designed a simple and fully functional chatbot builder. Creating a chatbot will be an easy task – you don’t need to write a single line of code. Just add a new bot, specify the triggers, and write a scenario.

Provide your visitors with the information they need, ask their questions, request info, or transfer visitors to a live chat operator using the Chaport bots.

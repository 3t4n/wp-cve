Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself, and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic installation of the COD Network plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “COD Network” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now", then "Activate".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you back up your site just in case.

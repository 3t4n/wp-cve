Map your post type and category archives to a page, and also map your 404 template to a page as well. Three helper blocks allow you to display a post grid, a term (category) grid, and posts by category.

== Description ==

A WordPress plugin for displaying posts and terms (e.g., categories) using a Gutenberg block. Works well with posts, pages, custom post types, taxonomies, and terms.

Bonus: archive mapping.

> Note: (2021-07-28) The blocks are deprecated as there are better custom query items and the new Query block in WordPress 5.8. Thank you for trying us out.

<ul>
	<li>Map your post type archives to a page for customization of the post type archive page.</li>
	<li>Map your category archives to a page for customization of the term archive page.</li>
	<li>Map your 404 template to a page and easily customize your 404 page.</li>
</ul>

The plugin currently has three blocks:

* <a href="https://mediaron.com/custom-query-blocks/custom-post-types-block/">Custom Post Types Block</a>
* <a href="https://mediaron.com/custom-query-blocks/term-category-grid-block/">Term (Category) Grid Block</a>
* <a href="https://mediaron.com/custom-query-blocks/featured-posts-by-category-block/">Featured Posts by Category Block</a>

=== Post Type Archive Mapping ===

This plugin allows you to map your custom post type archive pages. Just create a page and go to Settings->Reading to set the page for your archive.

Ensure your post types have <code>has_archive</code> set to true.

<ul>
<li>Select a Public page to use as your post type archive page.</li>
<li>View the archive and you will see the page content instead of the archive content.</li>
<li>Use page templates on your pages for flexibility.</li>
<li>Custom Gutenberg block for showing your posts.</li>
</ul>

=== Term Archive Mapping ===

This plugin also allows you to map your term archives to a page. Just create a page and go edit your term to set the archive page.

<ul>
<li>Create a public page to use as your term archive.</li>
<li>Visit the edit term page and select the page.</li>
<li>View the term and you will see your selected page.</li>
<li>Use Gutenberg on your public page to customize the archive.</li>
</ul>

=== 404 Page Mapping ===

This plugin allows you to map a page to your 404 template, so you can customize a 404 page as needed.

== Installation ==

1. Just unzip and upload the "post-type-archive-mapping" folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Post Type Archive Mapping

1. Create a custom post type that has an archive
2. Create a page with a custom template. Use the Gutenberg block to show off posts in that Custom Post Type.

4. Go to the post type archive and observe the page content is now the archive

Term Archive Mapping

1. Create a public page to use as your term archive.
2. Visit the edit term page and select the page.
3. View the term and you will see your selected page.
4. Use Gutenberg on your public page to customize the archive.

404 Template Mapping

1. Visit Settings->Reading and map your 404 template to a page.
2. Customize the new 404 page.
3. Navigate to a broken URL to preview the 404 page.

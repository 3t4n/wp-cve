This plugin adds the Portuguese "States", known as "Distritos", to WooCommerce and sets the correct address format for Portugal.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the 18 Portuguese "States" (known as "Distritos") plus the 2 Autonomous Regions (known as "RegiÃµes AutÃ³nomas", Madeira and AÃ§ores) to WooCommerce.

Also sets the right name for "Districts" and the correct "Postcode"/"City" order and the correct address format for Portugal.

And... thatâ€™s pretty much it.

= Features: =

* Adds the Portuguese "States", known as "Distritos", to WooCommerce
* Sets the correct address format for Portugal, including the correct "Postal Code"/"City" positioning on the checkout

= Do your customers still write the full address details manually on the checkout? =

Activate the automatic filling of the address details at the checkout, including street name and neighbourhood, based on the postal, avoiding incorrect data at the time of shipping, with our plugin [Portuguese Postcodes for WooCommerce](https://ptwooplugins.com/product/portuguese-postcodes-for-woocommerce-technical-support/)

The Portuguese Postcodes plugin can also do a district-postcode cross validation on checkout and guarantee they match.

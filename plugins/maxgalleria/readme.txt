Responsive WordPress Gallery plugin with built in Slider and Lightbox

== Description ==

[MaxGalleria](http://maxgalleria.com/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=maxgalleria&utm_content=maxgalleria&utm_campaign=repo) gives you a responsive WordPress gallery plugin that is a joy to use. MaxGalleria gives you a streamlined experience for creating and managing responsive WordPress galleries that look great on any device.

MaxGalleria has been going strong and improving for over 5 years.  We regularly update MaxGalleria and its addons plus we give terrific, timely support. We take great pride in the reviews by our users. Here are some of our favorites.

> **Perfect!** - Use it in combo with Media Library Folders. Great for sites having a lot of image galleries. Easy to organize them in separate folders using Media Library Folders and adding the images to MaxGalleria with a click of a button. Light box works great on all devices I have tested it. You can also specify how many images to load per page in order to lower the page load time. – from ditko74

> **Amazing!** - By far the best gallery plugin available to WordPress users. – from  itsjayd

> **Goodbye NextGEN Gallery. Hello MaxGalleria** - I've been looking for a replacement or alternative for the NextGEN Gallery plugin for some time, but couldn't settle on anything, specially because of the way most plugins and WordPress itself handles image organization. Enter MaxGalleria and and Media Library Folders which is a simpler way to manage images, an enhancement to the built in WordPress media manager and capable of creating folders to organize files and move them around. It's a great plugin. – from theYahzee

= Why do I need a Google Developer API Key to add Youtube videos to a gallery? =
Google has recently depreciated the use of the Youtube API version 2 which MaxGalleria uses. We have updated MaxGalleria version 3.1.8 to use version 3 of the API. The new API provides new features for application developers. And it also requires programs accessing Youtube data, such as thumbnails, titles and captions, to have a Google Developer API Key.

MaxGalleria users will now be directed to obtain a Google Developer API Key in order to add new videos to their galleries. Existing galleries are not effected by this change.

To obtain  an API key visit this page for instructions: [http://maxgalleria.com/youtube-api-key/](http://maxgalleria.com/youtube-api-key/)

= How does Media Library Folders work with MaxGalleria?
MaxGalleria works seamlessly with the plugins [Media Library Folders](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-library-plus/) and Media Library Folders Pro (available at [MaxGalleria.com](https://maxgalleria.com/downloads/media-library-plus-pro/)) to make organizing you images and files in a manner that suits your needs rather than using Wordpress’ default year/month folder scheme.  Media Library Folders allows you to create folders and subfolders, upload, move, copy or delete files in the folders you created. It also updates the links to files and images embedded in your posts and pages when you move or rename a file. And you can add images to existing MaxGalleria galleries from Media Library Folders. As a result, all your gallery images can be grouped according to folders in the Wordpress Media Library

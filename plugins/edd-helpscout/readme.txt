- Orders with status and link to payment providers

If using the Software Licensing add-on, the following information is shown as well:

- License keys. Links to the site manager in Easy Digital Downloads.
- Active sites, with a link to deactivate the license for the given site.
- Links to purchase an upgrade directly

When using Easy Digital Downloads with Recurring Payments:

- Subscriptions and their status

**How to install and configure**

Have a look at the [installation instructions](https://wordpress.org/plugins/edd-helpscout/installation/).

Please note that Help Scout changed their App interface. This plugin uses custom legacy apps, which you can learn more about [here](https://secure.helpscout.net/apps/custom).

**More information**

- Developers; follow or contribute to the [plugin on GitHub](https://github.com/webzunft/edd-helpscout)
- Other [WordPress plugins](https://profiles.wordpress.org/webzunft/#content-plugins) by Thomas Maier

== Installation ==

To get this up and running, you'll need to configure a few things in WordPress and Help Scout.

= WordPress =

1. Upload the contents of **edd-helpscout.zip** to your plugins directory, which usually is `/wp-content/plugins/`.
1. Activate the **Help Scout integration for Easy Digital Downloads** plugin
1. Set the **HELPSCOUT_SECRET_KEY** constant in your `/wp-config.php` file. This should be a random string of 40 characters.


_Example_

Replace `your-random-string` with your own random string.

`
define( 'HELPSCOUT_SECRET_KEY', 'your-random-string' );
`

= Help Scout =

1. Go to the [Help Scout custom app interface](https://secure.helpscout.net/apps/custom/).
1. Enter the following settings with adjustments according to your site’s URL and the secret key.

**App Name:** Easy Digital Downloads<br />
**Content Type:** Dynamic Content<br />
**Callback URL:** https://YOUR-SITE.COM/edd-helpscout-api/customer_info _(I recommend using HTTPS)_ <br />
**Secret Key:** The value of your **HELPSCOUT_SECRET_KEY** constant.

= Testing the plugin locally =

You can set the plugin in some test mode.
Set `HELPSCOUT_DUMMY_DATA` to `true` and `HELPSCOUT_DUMMY_DATA_EMAIL` to an email address in `wp-config.php` to let the plugin use dummy data.
You can then call https://your-site.com/edd-helpscout-api/customer_info directly and get a reply based on the value of `HELPSCOUT_DUMMY_DATA_EMAIL`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help Scout just shows "Invalid Signature" =

Make sure the "Secret Key" setting for your Help Scout application matches the value of your `HELPSCOUT_SECRET_KEY` constant. This key is used to authorize requests coming from HelpScout.

== Screenshots ==

1. Customer overview with Licenses area opened by default

= 2.0 =

The original developer Danny van Kooten stopped working on EDD Help Scout since he no longer uses it.
The development of the plugin was taken over by Thomas Maier from https://wpadvancedads.com, who continues using the plugin.
Danny left in the middle of developing a better version 2.0. I decided to build in top of that because the changes show a lot potential and fixed some issues.
Please test carefully and let me know in case something is missing or not working as expected.

**Additions**

- callback URL changed from https://your-site.com/edd-helpscout/api to https://your-site.com/edd-helpscout-api/customer_info, though both are working for now
- added name of the customer and link to the profile page in EDD since Help Scout doesn‘t show it for everyone
- set `HELPSCOUT_DUMMY_DATA` and `HELPSCOUT_DUMMY_DATA_EMAIL` constants in `wp-config.php` to let the plugin use dummy data

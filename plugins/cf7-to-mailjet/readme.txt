Link Contact Form 7 with Mailjet contact list

== Description ==

Contact Form 7 to Mailjet is a plugin developed by Youdemus.

This plugin allows you to automatically fill in a contact list on Mailjet, or database, each time a user submits a contact form on your WordPress website with Contact Form 7.

The huge benefit of this plugin is that it allows you to create a specific email's database on Mailjet to distinguish contacts from your site. You can also specify a specific list for each of your forms.

This plugin requires that the official Mailjet plugin is properly configured (API). This is not an official Contact Form 7 plugin or Mailjet plugin.

It is also possible to associate a check box for the GPRD if you have one in your contact form.

For help in installation, please check FAQ or contact us directly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to add the square brackets ? =

Nope ! For example, if you have [email your-email] in contact form 7 you just have to place your-email in contact form 7 to mailjet admin page in email field. That's exactly the same for name, checkbox and secondary fields. Feel free to contact us for help (French and english speaking).

= How do I find the contact list ID in Mailjet ? =

You can get the contact list ID in Mailjet website dashboard -> Contacts menu.

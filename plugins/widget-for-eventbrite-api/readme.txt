This plugin uses the Eventbrite API to read directly from Evenbrite servers creating and event feed for Eventbrite. Don't be put off by the words API, that just means the plugin is linked directly to Eventbrite data - no rekeying, no extra data to manage, simplifying and automating your event marketing.

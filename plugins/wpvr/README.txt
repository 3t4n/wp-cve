**Connect Multiple 360° Panorama Images to Create A Complete Virtual Tour**

You can use multiple 360 degree images of any house or location in a virtual tour to create Scenes covering different rooms, corners, or spots.

Connect these Panorama Scenes using Scene-type Hotspots so all the 360 degree images join together and form a complete virtual tour of the location.

**Your viewers can move inside or back and forth in this virtual tour as if it’s a real-life tour.**

You can connect up to 5 scenes, and add 5 hotspots per scene on a virtual tour. To create tours with unlimited scenes and hotspots, [click here](https://rextheme.com/wpvr/#pricing)

==Show Information with Interactive Hotspots==

You can use engaging hotspots to give information using:

✅ Texts.
✅ Images.
✅ GIFs.
✅ URLs.
✅ Videos.
✅ Buttons.

Or a combination of any of these in 2 ways:

- Show information for Hotspot On-hover action.
- Show information after Hotspot On-click action.

You’ll have full HTML Editor/[WYSIWYG Editor support to set up Hotspot content](https://rextheme.com/docs/wysiwyg-html-editor-hotspot-content-virtual-tour/).

Also, you’ll have over **900+ custom icons** for these hotspots which you can further customize with any color you want and a ripple animation option.

https://youtu.be/rOAX7gqT7HQ?feature=shared

It's a great way to grab your viewer's attention!

== Interactive Virtual Floor Plan for Meaningful Direction (Pro)==

You can easily [create a complete floor plan](https://rextheme.com/docs/virtual-floor-plans-inside-tours/) for your property, store, showroom, or any other place you own.

Real Estate Floor plans are really popular among realtors and agencies and you can also utilize them to spice up your real estate tours.

Upload the floor plan to WPVR, set pointers on that floor map for every 360 panorama scene you’ve created, and simply connect the pointers with the scenes.

That’s it! [A complete & interactive virtual floor plan](https://rextheme.com/virtual-floor-plan-release) is ready inside your tour.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqi_Yajk9nc

You can customize the pointer designs however you want with different colors.

== 🔗 Share the Virtual Tours on Different Social Platforms (Pro)==

With WP VR you can easily share your virtual tours on different [Social Media Platforms ](https://rextheme.com/docs/how-to-share-virtual-tour-on-social-media/) like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Email, and Reddit without having it published on the Web page.

== Share the 360 Virtual Tours with QR Code (Pro)==

WP VR can generate a [QR Code](https://rextheme.com/docs/how-to-publish-virtual-tours-using-qr-code/) automatically for your virtual tour which will help you showcase your tours without having it published on the Web page.

== ▶️ The Simplest 360 Video Player for WordPress ==

WPVR lets you add 360 degree videos in the easiest way in WordPress.

You can self-host the 360 degree videos on your media folder, embed a YouTube 360 video, or set up a Vimeo 360° video on your WordPress site without any hassle.

==Cardboard & VR Headset Support for Full Immersive Experience (Pro) 🕶️==

== Use High Quality Panorama Images Without WordPress Restriction==

WordPress has a default Large Image Handler that automatically compresses and reduces the quality of any image above 2560x1280 pixels when you upload it.

A good 360 panorama image usually comes with a very high resolution that can easily go over 3000x1500 pixels.

So the large image handler makes your entire virtual tour lose quality.

**WPVR comes with the option to disable this restriction so that you can easily upload panorama images that can be more than 3000 pixels in width.**

*You can use any high-quality jpeg, png, webp etc. panorama images to create virtual tours with WPVR*

**Mobile First VR Approach**

WPVR is designed with a mobile-friendly output in mind and all the tours you make will be fully responsive and weightless for mobile devices.

Faster Virtual Tour Loading on Phone: Enable the Auto-resize feature to produce a lighter version of your 360 panoramic images only for mobile phones.

*Custom Tour Height for Mobile View:*

To keep the initial view of your virtual tours more interactive on a mobile device, you can set mobile-only virtual tour height for each virtual tour.


*Notice for Smartphones:*

You can show custom front-end notices to help out the virtual tour viewers from smartphones.

== Installation ==

1. Upload WPVR to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Follow the setup wizard to configure the plugin for use


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=1. Why Do I Need WP VR?=

You can easily create a Virtual Tour of your place using WP VR to build a virtual presence of your business.

Simply provide a 360 degree panoramic photo and this plugin will create a virtual tour that your visitors can navigate easily.

Allow your prospects to have a realistic tour of your facility before they decide to purchase your service and increase your conversion rate.

=2. How to Install and Activate WP VR?=

Once you have downloaded the file, go to your dashboard. Under Plugins, select Add New, and upload the file. Then Install and activate the plugin.

Once activated, on the left side under your dashboard, you will find the option WP VR at the bottom.

=3. What Kind of Images Should I Use To Create A Virtual Tour?=

To make a perfect equirectangular image, you need to use a 360 degree panoramic photo of the area you want to preview.

However, you can also capture panorama images with your smartphone and use them to create a partial panorama tour.

=5. Can I Customize The Hotspot Icons?=

Yes. You can create a custom class on your theme, stating whatever style you want.

Then you can input the class name on the Hotspot Custom Class section in a hotspot, and the content displayed will be customized according to the style you set.

=6. Can I Create A 360 Degree Video Tour With WPVR?=

Yes, with WP VR, you can create a 360 Degree video tour.

You can either upload the video to create a tour or set a link to a Youtube/Vimeo 360 degree video.

=7. How To Embed A Virtual Tour Using Gutenberg Block Editor?=

Under common blocks, you will find a block called WPVR. Select the block and on the dynamic toolbar on the right, you will get the options to add ID, Height, and Width.

Collect the ID from the virtual tour you created. Assign the height and width as you desire.

=8. The Tour Is Not Loading On The Webpage.=

Go to your WordPress Dashboard > WPVR > Get Started > Settings.

Check the Enable Script Control option status.

If the Enable Script Control option is turned On, turn it off and reload the tour page.

If you wish to use this feature, you have to set the URLs of all the pages on your site with a virtual tour in the List of Allowed Pages To Load WPVR Scripts field.

=9. What To Do If I Get "THE FILE (image link) COULD NOT BE ACCESSED"  Error?=

Sometimes when you add a tour to your site, you might face this issue, rather than loading the tour it will give the error "THE FILE (...) COULD NOT BE ACCESSED."

This error shows up when you are running a website under "HTTPS" (secured with SSL certificate) whereas your image link is under "HTTP" (unsecured).

To solve this issue, go to your WordPress Dashboard > Settings > General.

Here make sure you have "HTTP" added to both "WordPress Address (URL)" and "Site Address (URL)".

And that's it. Your virtual tour should load with no issues.

=10. Can I make The Virtual Tours Full-width?=

Yes, you can publish the tours as the full width of your page/post.

For Gutenberg, Elementor, and Oxygen builder, set fullwidth on the Width field. For shortcodes, set width = "fullwidth".

=11. What If I Use An Optimization or Caching Plugin?=

If you use any Optimization or Caching plugins, then you need to exclude WP VR from its optimization function.

Simply add '/plugins/wpvr' to the exclusion field (or use the location where you store plugins).

=12. Can I Allow The Users of My Site To Create Virtual Tours?=

You can only allow the backend users like Admins, Editors, and Authors of your site to create virtual tours.

Admins & editors will have access to all virtual tours on the site to modify, update and delete them.

Authors can access their own tours only and modify, update, or delete them.

Admins can remove access from Authors and Editors at any time.

= 13. How can I report security bugs? =
You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/wpvr)

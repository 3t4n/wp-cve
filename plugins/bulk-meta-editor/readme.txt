== Description ==
Bulk updates the metadata such as the title, description, canonical url, and the indexing of a page. Created for most Web Developers and SEO Specialists who do website audits. **Currently supports Yoast** as of the moment.

This plugin was created a way to solve my problem to bulk update the metadata since I was doing SEO audit and implementation.

PRO Version is also available. It allows you to do more and supports WooCommerce out of the box and taxonomies such as categories and tags.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does WooCommerce supported? =
Yes, WooCommerce is supported is partially supported on the normal version. You can only bulk update the product pages. On PRO version, however, can fully support product categories and tags.

= Why taxonomies only available to PRO version? =
The plugin currently supports Yoast out of the box. Yoast has a different way of saving the metadata in the database. I have invested my time in finding the best and efficient solution to bulk update the metadata.

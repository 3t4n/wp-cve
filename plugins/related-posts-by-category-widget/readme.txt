- Number of Posts to Show - Set how many posts are listed in the widget
- Order By - Choose how the related posts will be ordered (including random posts)
- Show Category Names - Toggle whether category names are displayed above groups of posts
- Link Cat Name to Archive - If category names are being shown, choose to have them link to the category archive page for that category

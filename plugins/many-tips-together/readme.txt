== Description ==

With Admin Tweaks you'll be able to simplify and make **deep customizations** in the administrative interface.
It's a compilation of hooks for enhancing, styling and reducing WordPress backend.

Do you like to adjust and style the backend as much as the frontend?
So, we are together!

= Main Features =
* Admin Bar: remove, add and modify menu items.
* Admin Menus: remove menu and submenu items; sort Settings menu; rename "Posts".
* Appearance: hide general elements; create admin notices.
* Dashboard: remove and add widgets.
* General Settings: enable arcane Link Manager; privacy; other misc options.
* Listings: customize rows and columns for post types, users and plugins.
* Media: custom columns; re-attachment; sanitize filenames; jpeg quality; audio/photo/video metadata.
* Plugins: many row modifications; live filter by keyword/active/inactive;.
* User Profile: remove almost everything; add custom CSS.
* Login: redirects; errors; modify almost everything; add custom CSS.
* Maintenance Mode: with minimum Role allowed and possibility to block only the backend.


== Installation ==
1. Upload `many-tips-together.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.
3. Go to *Settings -> Admin Tweaks* and have fun.

= Uninstall =
The 'reset' button doesn't delete the database entry, but if you delete the plugin, the entry will be deleted (via unsinstall.php)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why Many Tips Together? And why change its name to Admin Tweaks? =
The first version of the plugin was a compilation of snippets.
It evolved to a General Admin Tweak plugin.
Most of the users who left feedback complained about it: too cryptic and hard to find.
Well, I agree, but I'm just changing the Display Name.
The Repository URL, Directory Name and Database Option Name are still keep original name.

= Login CSS =
Look for inspiration at [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/search/pens?q=wordpress+login+&order=relevance).

== Acknowledgments ==

* Everything changed after [WordPress Stack Exchange](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/)
* Plugin interface using @bainternet's [Admin Page Class](https://github.com/bainternet/Admin-Page-Class)
* CSS for hiding help texts adapted from [Admin Expert Mode](http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-expert-mode/)
* Everything started with [Adminimize](http://wordpress.org/plugins/adminimize/), by Frank BÃ¼eltge, which does an awesome job hiding WordPress elements, but I wanted more, and these are some of the great resources where I found many snippets: [Stack Exchange](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/1567/best-collection-of-code-for-your-functions-php-file), [WPengineer](http://wpengineer.com), [wpbeginner](http://www.wpbeginner.com), [CSS-TRICKS](http://css-tricks.com), [Smashing Magazine](http://wp.smashingmagazine.com), [Justin Tadlock](http://justintadlock.com)...
* The option to hide the help texts from many areas of WordPress uses the CSS file of the plugin [Admin Expert Mode](http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-expert-mode/), by Scott Reilly.

== Settings and configurations ==

The following are configuration options you can modify as you see fit:

* __Voice style:__ Choose the type of reading you would like to use. For example, choose news (formal) for formal news content. Please note that only narrators that have a wave icon next to the, support voice styles.
* __Play premium version:__ In case the voice has a better version than chosen, click it to hear how it could sound like.
* __Default player speed:__ Choose the default player speed. Listeners could still change it from the player menu if needed.
* __Theme:__ Choose the player theme you want.
* __The player itself:__ Click the play to listen to a sample from the selected narrator.

* __Skip HTML tags:__ Use this if you want to avoid generating audio for specific parts of posts based on the tags (content blacklist).
* __Allow shortcodes:__ By default, the Trinity Audio player will read only the textual content of your post and will filter out all additional texts generated using plugins or shortcodes. If you would like to add shortcodes that you would like the player to read, please add them using comma delimiter. For example: vc_row, vc_column, su_heading, etc... After you change those settings, make sure to use "Activate for all posts" to allow those configurations to update.
* __Player position:__ The position of the audio player on your page. We recommend placing the player before the main article text.
* __Player label:__ Specifies optional text you’d like to be shown above the audio player (HTML tags are supported with this label).
* __Help us reach more users:__ Choose if you want to display credit next to the player. We’d very much appreciate it if you choose to give us credit.
* __Resource preconnect:__ This feature will allow us to load the player faster on your page so we strongly advise enabling it.
* __New post default:__ Enable this to make sure that the Trinity Audio player will be added to each new post you publish.

    In case you already know what elements are being read and shouldn’t, use the "Skip HTML tags" section in the plugin. Place the relevant HTML elements the player should avoid.

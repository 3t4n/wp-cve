Simple. Fast. 259 languages. Mobile-friendly. Rock-solid (GeSHi).

== Description ==

**• [Live demo](https://gehrcke.de/wp-geshi-highlight-demo/)**

**• Highlights:**

* Supports [259 languages](https://github.com/GeSHi/geshi-1.0/tree/v1.0.9.1/src/geshi).
* Server-side. Saves bandwidth, latency, and battery compared to client-side rendering.
* Near-zero load on the backend. With a caching solution this does not affect your page load time at all.
* Line numbering. If you want to (no vertical displacements between code line and line number).
* Default style was tested with more than 20 themes, including Twenty Ten to Fifteen, and tweaked based on a bunch of user feedback.
* If you'd like to tweak the style: just provide your own CSS file. Styles are highly & easily configurable.
* Per-block styles: each code block on a single page can be styled on its own (if that is something you would liked to do).
* Clean, small and valid HTML output.
* Well-documented source code using modern WordPress API calls.
* I have maintained this plugin for several years and I plan to continue to provide support.
* Based on [GeSHi](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/), a reliable and well-established PHP highlighting engine, used by popular community forum applications such as phpBB or wiki applications such as Dokuwiki or MediaWiki.

WP-GeSHi-Highlight works as a drop-in replacement for [WP-Syntax](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/), which does not seem to be maintained anymore (as of 2015). Make the switch, it should just work (let me know how it went)!

**• Usage:**

WordPress 5 users: for now I have tested this plugin only with the [Classical Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/). Gutenberg is not yet supported (it may work though, let me know).

Recommendation: *use the "Text" (raw) editor*. Do not use the "Visual" editor. Switching between both may corrupt the contents of your code blocks.

In the text editor insert code blocks as `pre` blocks, and use the `lang` argument to define the language of the code snippet:

`<pre lang="language">
    CODE
</pre>`

A short example for the `bash` language:

`<pre lang="bash">
    $ dd if=/dev/zero of=image.ext3 bs=1M count=10000 oflag=append conv=notrunc
</pre>`

Publish/preview, and have a look at the result!

Also check out the reference documentation for all available options. You can find it on the [plugin's website](https://gehrcke.de/wp-geshi-highlight). Note that more usage examples can be found on the [demo website](https://gehrcke.de/wp-geshi-highlight-demo/).

**• Issues:**

A bunch of websites have used this plugin for years, and it seems to serve its purpose well. If you find an issue please let me know: drop a [mail](mailto:jgehrcke@googlemail.com) or leave a [comment](http://gehrcke.de/wp-geshi-highlight).

**• Theme compatibility of the default style sheet:**

The default style sheet was tested with recent versions of all official themes (Twenty Ten to Twenty Fifteen), and with a large range of non-official themes such as Vantage, Customizr, ColorWay, Zerif Lite, Responsive, Storefront, Virtue, evolve, Make, Sparkling, Spacious, Enigma, Sydney, Point, Interface, SinglePage.

Certain themes might define styles with a high specificity that negatively affect the visual code block appearance. It is difficult to impossible to anticipate all these cases in advance, so I expect this to happen in rare cases (the past has proven that these things happen). So, I need you to look out for these situations, and please report them!

== Screenshots ==
I feel that a [live demonstration](https://gehrcke.de/wp-geshi-highlight-demo/) is better than just screenshots.

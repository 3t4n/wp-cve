Stop content pirates from placing their calls-to-action, ads, affiliate links & opt-ins over top of your website content.

== Description ==

You have spent a lot of time and effort building your website, creating your own calls-to-action, and strategizing your goals. The thought of someone throwing their own CTAs over top of your content without you knowing about it is probably both scary and infuriating.

This type of unsolicited activity can be accomplished by using apps such as:

* Sniply
* Linkis
* Start A Fire

The *Frame Buster by Warfare Plugins* will detect any instance of your website being shown inside of a frame or a rerouted URL version of your content and redirect visitors to the original content (without the unsolicited calls-to-action). This ensures that content pirates cannot redirect traffic, leads and conversions to their own calls-to-action.

= How this Started =

This whole plugin was the product of a conversation that *erupted* on Google+ when one user discovered *Sniply* and was outraged by the idea of people creating their own ads and placing them overtop of their website without permission.

Over 200 comments and a couple hours later, *Frame Buster* was born and then baked into our flagship social sharing plugin, [Social Warfare](https://warfareplugins.com/). We decided this type of public service was too important to place behind a barrier of entry, so we decided to [give it away](https://warfareplugins.com/sniply-buster/) 100% free.
While it is still baked right into *Social Warfare*, we thought it only best to give it an official home in the *WordPress Repository*. So enjoy, keep your content safe, and keep creating awesome things worthy of attempted hijacking.

Major features in Swifty Bar include:

* Shows current post category, post title and authors first and last name.

* Share buttons for most popular social networks (new ones comming soon).
* Number of Comments and click to scroll to comment form.

* Admin Panel to customize each module.
* Supports custom post types.

* Share counter

**Share Count in 1.2!**

We introduced share count in latest version of swifty bar. We are saving share counts inside WP Transients to keep things fast and fetching new shares once user clicks on any of the share icons, if no clicks have been made, share will refresh once daily, that way site is doing minimal requests to the share APIs which boosts its speed by ALOT.

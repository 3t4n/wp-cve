WPC Added To Cart Notification will open a popup to notify the customer immediately after adding a product to cart.

== Description ==

**WPC Added to Cart Notification** is a useful plugin for completing a smooth shopping flow in your online store. It displays an added to cart notification popup in a beautiful way when a product is added to the cart from the single product page or shop/archive page. This tool boosts the user experience for your site and helps customers acknowledge what’s been added to cart while giving prompts of what to do next.

Remarkably, this plugin is integrated with great features from other [WPC plugins](https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpclever/#content-plugins) that helps you boost the display to serve more purposes and make use of every detail in the popup to promote cross-products on site. The notification can be customized to the most to the fewest details as users prefer from the plugin settings.

= Powerful Notifications =

This plugin is truly easy to use as users would know where to start right after installing this on their site. It not only displays a notification that tells buyers something is added to the cart, but it also shows a hint about where to go next with a customizable View Cart, Checkout & Continue Shopping buttons. Moreover, the multitude of popup effects available for users to utilize can enhance the shopping experience to a great extent and make things flow fluently on your site.

With two modes offered: Popup or Notiny, it’s possible to change between these modes to make sure the notification stands out or appears in a simple way as a Notiny. Users can also adjust the layout of the popup to match with the screen orientation: vertical or horizontal.

= Complete the Shopping Flow =

The most remarkable functionality of this WPC Added to Cart Notification plugin is to complete the shopping flow for your buyers. It encourages customers to browse for more products or offers similar or related to what they have just added to the cart. Combining with other WPC plugins, the conversion rate will positively be improved:

- WPC Fly Cart: display the mini-cart popup immediately with the added to cart notification. If you show the Checkout button right on the notification popup, it’s possible for buyers to use the Instant Checkout of the Fly Cart popup (Premium version) to skip cart and checkout faster
- WPC Free Shipping Bar: encourage people to upsize their order to enjoy free shipping
- WPC Countdown Timer: create a sense of urgency and scarcity with a countdown timer
- WPC AJAX Add to Cart: facilitate the add to cart loading if your site is using AJAX
- WPC Smart Messages: display an engaging message with countdown timer for special or promotional notices
- WPC Share Cart: share the list of products added to cart via social media

The display of an added to cart notification will mean more than just a notice especially in sales seasons when the “holding/grasping” of a favorite/widely-sought-after item is really a competing task. Letting your buyers know that they have successfully grasped a hot item will urge them to check out faster before the item is gone to someone else.

= Auto-close Timer =

If you’re concerned that the display of notification would interfere with your customers’ navigation, then the Auto-close timer is the solution to this. Users are able to set the timer to automatically close this notification so that clients won’t encounter any inconvenience during their site navigation.

We also provide Premium users with a free customization service in which they can request for simple adjustments of the notification popup’s appearance to match with their site’s design scheme.

= Premium: Suggested Products =

In the Premium version, it’s possible to do a cross-product promotion via the notification popup with Suggested products from:

- Related products (products under the same categories or tags)
- Cross-sell products (linked products)
- Upsell products (linked products)
- Items in their [WPC Smart Wishlist](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-smart-wishlist/) list
- Items in their [WPC Smart Compare](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-smart-compare/) list

With our [WPC plugin](https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpclever/#content-plugins) ecosystem, it’s even more convenient to use [WPC Custom Related Products](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-custom-related-products/) or [WPC Smart Linked Products](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-smart-linked-products/) plugin to configure related/upsells/cross-sells in bulk with smart conditions.

= Translators =

Available Languages: English (Default), Russian, Czech, French

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update for an existing one, you can send [gettext PO and MO file](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress "Translating WordPress") to [us](https://wpclever.net/contact?utm_source=pot&utm_medium=wooac&utm_campaign=wporg "WPClever.net") so we can bundle it into WPC Added To Cart Notification.

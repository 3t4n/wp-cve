== Description ==

Generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown by using [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/)

WP Mermaid is smart enough that loads mermaid.js only when your posts contain Mermaid syntax, by detecting the use of shortcode and block. So it will not be loaded on your website everywhere.

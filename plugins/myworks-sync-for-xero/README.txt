= Connection Information =

**Sync your WooCommerce store to Xero through your MyWorks account by utilizing the MyWorks Sync Xero App. We (MyWorks Sync) are a service provider that allows you to connect your site to your Xero company, and this plugin establishes this connection for you on your WooCommerce Store.**

You will be able to connect to Xero from within your account with us, and use this connection in our MyWorks Sync plugin on your WooCommerce Store to sync your store with Xero. MyWorks only stores your connection keys/details - and does so securely. All other data is handled and stored by Xero. All data transmitted passes directly to Xero from your website, and does not pass through our systems.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements to use MyWorks Sync? =
MyWorks Sync requires a recent version of Wordpress (5.1+) with WooCommerce (4.0+) installed. Your server should run on Linux and have at least PHP 7.4. You also need an active trial or paid plan with MyWorks at <https://myworks.software/pricing/#woocommerce+xero>

= What Xero countries/versions do you support? =
MyWorks Sync supports all versions/countries of Xero, including any tax and currency for your locale.

= Do you support QuickBooks Online? =
We do support syncing with QuickBooks, with the same robust features included in our Xero Sync. You can view our sync with QuickBooks here.
<https://myworks.software/integrations/woocommerce-quickbooks-sync/>

= Do you have a free trial? =
Even better! We have a completely free Launch plan you can use to get up and syncing right away. As your order volume / functionality needs grow, you can change to our paid plans at any time.


= How does the sync work?  Will old data be automatically synced? =
As soon as you finish setting up our sync, we'll only start automatically syncing NEW data. This automatic sync can be enabled/disabled individually for different data types, like customers, orders, products, inventory and more - so you can control which new data you'd like to automatically sync. OLD (historic) data will NOT be automatically synced - but it's easy as pie to push over, using our Push section!

= How does support work? =
All plans include 24/7 support ticket assistance with our amazing US/UK support team! Paid plans include a complimentary 30 minute setup call/screenshare, and our Scale plan includes 12/5 phone support.

= Can I sync data both ways between Xero and WooCommerce? =
Absolutely! Our sync  gives you the ability to automatically sync products & inventory (paid plans only) both directions between WooCommerce and Xero  - automatically and manually (pushing historic data). 

= Can I push existing/old customers, orders & products into Xero? =
Heck ya! You can use our Push section to push your existing customers, products, orders and more into Xero - and even pull products into WooCommerce from Xero! (Our monthly plans have a limit of pushing up to the last 30 days of orders, and the forever free Launch plan has a limit of up to the last 7 days of orders.)

= Will orders be synced as soon as they're placed? =
They sure will! Why wait all day? Our sync is in real-time – so new customers, products, orders and more will be automatically synced right away! (Inventory level sync happens every 5 minutes.) You can control at which WooCommerce Status that orders are synced.

= Can I sync multiple stores to one Xero company? =
Yes, you can sync as many WooCommerce stores as you’d like to the same Xero account. You will just need a paid plan for each store.

= If I have some data already entered into Xero, will it be duplicated? =
Our sync never duplicates customers, orders or products! If we've already synced an order into Xero, you can update/push it in WooCommerce, and we'll simply update it in Xero. If you have orders in Xero entered manually or by another integration - that's not a problem. Our sync may not recognize them if they don't match your WooCommerce order number, but we won't attempt to automatically re-sync them.

= Are there any more FAQ or Docs? =
There sure are! Visit our growing docs site at <https://support.myworks.software>

= How easy is the setup? Will I be able to get help if I need it? = 
It's almost too easy! All you'll have to do is connect to Xero and map any existing data together - that's it! We have easy to follow documentation, a setup wizard and even a setup video tutorial - all to make your setup as seamless as possible! You'll always have 24/7 support ticket access in your account with us, and our sales team has been known to assist with setup questions over our 12/5 live chat as well :) Our paid plans even include a complimentary setup call/screenshare so we can help answer any questions and make sure you're up and running correctly!


= Where should my products be as I start getting set up with MyWorks? =
A: We recommend you at least start with all your products in WooCommerce, and each should have a unique SKU (although not required, it's helpful to you going forward). If all of your products are in Xero, that’s fine too – you’ll be able to pull them into WooCommerce through our sync. Or - you can start out with a perfectly clean slate, and optionally have us automatically sync new products as you create them.

= Are you compatible with variations, groups, bundled products & composite products? =
A: We sure are! Although Bundled & Composite products are not native to WooCommerce (added by a plugin), we still have built-in compatibility with them, so you're all covered!

= Are there any WooCommerce extensions/plugins you're already compatible with? =
A: There sure are! We support over 25+ popular WooCommerce extensions - all included in our paid plans! A few examples of our built-in compatibility are Sequential Order Numbers Pro, Cost of Goods Sold, Avalara, Taxify, WooCommerce Subscriptions and Product Bundles.

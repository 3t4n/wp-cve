## 🚀 Main Features: FREE Version##

Bulk Price Editor is a really simple feature to use yet it's extremely powerful. Basically what this function helps you to do is to change the prices of "all" of your products or "some" of your products based on the criteria that you specify and with the amount that you specify. Here are the main features:

### 🚀 **Change all prices to a fixed amount in bulk** ###
Set all product prices into a specific price that you determine. This is extremely helpful when you're selling closely priced products and want to apply a sitewide offer, so you can sell all products on your site for $10 for example (similar to Udemy offers).
### 🚀 **Bulk edit prices by multiplying prices with any value** ### 
Eventhough the feature name is 'multiply' you can use it to reduce product prices by multiplying by fractions, so if you want to run a sitewide discount by %30 for example you can multiply by 0.7 so the prices change to 70% of what it has originally been that way a %30 perecent discount has been applied.
### 🚀 **Increase product prices by a fixed amount** ###
If your profit margins drop due to changes in wholesale prices, or anywhere in the supply chain, you can compensate these changes by adding a fixed amount to your prices so your profit margins is not negatively impacted.
### 🚀 **Bulk edit sale or regular prices (or both)** ###
Choose to which type of prices would like to apply these changes: regular price, sales price, or both.
### 🚀 **Select to bulk edit prices by category** ###
Choose to which category of items do you want to apply these changes, to your whole store or to a specific product category that you specifically want to apply these changes.

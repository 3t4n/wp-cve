== FEATURES ==

**🏄‍♀️ Automated Cookie Scan**
You will get your domain scanned automatically on a regular basis to detect new scripts that place cookies. This enables you to have a continuously updated cookie policy where your cookies are classified and documented.

**✋🏽 Automatic Cookie Blocking**
You are enabled to block first party cookies and trackers until consent is given. You also have the option to block third party cookies.


**🫙🍪 Automated Cookie Policy**
You will get a dynamic cookie policy, updated automatically, in sync with the cookie scans. Your visitors can access the cookie policy on the cookie banner and, for example, the website's footer.

The cookie policy feature enables you to deliver total transparency to your visitors.

**👩🏽‍🎨 Customizable**
Make sure your cookie banner represents your company's graphical profile: from choosing a banner template to inserting your logo and implementing your brand colors.

**🏆 Integration with Google Consent Mode**
It's easy to enable Google Consent Mode v2, ensuring that Google services get the consent signals they need. Not using Google Consent Mode v2, nor a cookie-banner, is not an option if you want to be able to work with remarketing and optimize bidding.

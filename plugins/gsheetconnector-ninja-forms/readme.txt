If the Entries never shows in your Sheet then one of these things might be the reason:
Wrong access code or did not allowed permission to Google Drive and Google Sheets(Check debug log under Integration Tab)
Not Entered Correct Sheet Name, Sheet ID or Tab Name, Tab ID
It also happens due to Wrong Column name mapping ( keep in mind that not to use special characters like underscores, double or single code, space etc.)
Please double-check those items and hopefully getting them right will fix the issue.

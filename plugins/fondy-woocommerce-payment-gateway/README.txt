== Platform features and benefits ==

= Easy to get started =
Fast and friendly onboarding is one of the key advantages of Fondy. You just need to register in the personal account of the platform, enter payment information, sign an electronic agreement and undergo an express audit of the site by our specialists.

The procedure takes from 1 hour to 2 days. After that you can accept payments from the customers, create online invoices in your account and engage in business development.

= Payment security =
To ensure a high level of security and availability of the platform we placed it in a cloud service that meets the top ten security standards, has protection against DDoS attacks and ensures that there is no physical access by unauthorized persons and organizations to the data and equipment.

Every year we pass PCI DSS certification. We also developed and constantly update our own anti-fraud system consisting of three levels: barrier, analytical, post-operator. This means that the fraudsters have no chance.

= Customer care =
When they first pay, the clients enter the card data and selects their favourite method of payment, the platform will save them in encrypted form. All the following payments will be made for your customers in 1 click, without having to enter any data and fill in the fields. Such care removes unnecessary barriers to purchase, the customers do not have to look for a card or recall the CVV code.

For those who regularly buy goods or purchase subscription services in Fondy, you can set up periodic debiting of money from the card (account) once a week/month/year using the payment calendar. The client will not have to bother with repeated payments, and you will always receive money on time.

= Flexible payment options =
It so happens that the client paid the order and the goods were not in stock. The seller gets into an awkward situation. For such cases Fondy offers a holding mechanism — freezing money in a client’s account for a while. If there is no product, you can return the money back to the client in 1 click.

There are many cases when you need to check the client’s solvency or freeze a certain amount on his account. Often holding is used by car rental services, hotels, delivery services, taxi services.

= Mobile payments =
Fondy is fully optimized for use on smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, TVs. Your customers will be comfortable to make purchases from any device.

We also took care of the sellers, they can access the personal account via the web interface or a convenient mobile application for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudipsp.fondyportal&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ua/app/fondy-merchant-portal/id1273277350?l=en). From the application you can view the statistics, generate invoices, work with payments.

= Smart analytics =
We help the sellers get to better know their customers. The built-in analytics system allows real-time tracking of the status of all the payments, to see at what stage of the purchase each customer is.

The system also provides analytics on customers, showing in which ways payment is most often made, from which devices, countries and in what currency. The received data can be viewed in your Fondy account or converted into reports and saved to a computer.

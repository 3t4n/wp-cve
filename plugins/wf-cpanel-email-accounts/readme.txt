WebFacing‚Ñ¢ - Email Accounts management for cPanel¬Æ 

== Description ==

üï∏Ô∏è By [WebFacing‚Ñ¢](https://webfacing.eu/). Read, send, show, manage, list, create, add, remove or delete email accounts, old messages, forwarders and autoresponders.
One click read, send and manage all your emails without a login step. Update notification recipients. Backup and download your complete cPanel¬Æ account.

This plugin requires your site is hosted on a cPanel¬Æ equipped server.

It uses it's UAPI through shell access by default, or via HTTP API. Using without `shell_exec` initially requires a temporary access token generated in the cPanel¬Æ native interface.

=== Limitations, security, privacy - be warned ===

* Maximum New Forwarders = 20, Maximum New Accounts = 5, weekly reset
* Trial: Maximum New Forwarders as **bulk entry** = 4, Maximum New Accounts as **bulk entry** = 2
* <ins>Now works without shell access!</ins> <del>Will not work at all if `shell_exec` is disabled in `php.ini`</del>
* Works only for admins, or other users with a custom `cpanel` capability and email on site domain (so far)
* Any admin (if multisite, only network admins), or user with the filtered capability, on a site, can fully access <em>any</em> account on the cPanel¬Æ server instance
* No AYS warnings for delete actions
* If several sites/admins share the same cPanel¬Æ account, without being part of a WP Multisite network, no bulletproof separation, because of the way the cPanel¬Æ UAPI CLI works, with or without this plugin

== Pro Addon ==

- Pro Addon plugin will be released May 1, 2023 at https::/webfacing.eu/ and will unlock **in bulk entry** new forwarders and new accounts to the numbers in the purchesed license


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this (free) plugin limit the it's use in any way? =

- Yes, **in bulk entry** of new forwaders and new accounts is considered a just trial for the Pro Edition, not included or supported in free plugin after being used once

- No, in spite the that it will ask you, in a standard, dismissable admin notice, to consider the Pro addon after 20 new forwarders, or 10 new accounts, per week, it doesn't stop you from continuing to add more

= The latest version has a regression and don't work as well as it did in previous version, but other things are fixed and I like the new features, what can I do? =

Please, immediately download and reinstall the **previous version** from the Advanced tab here, observe that the new issues are no longer present, then post in the support forum here.

= Does this plugin add database tables, store many options, crons/scheduled tasks, custom post type content or lines to `wp-config.php` or write to any existing file? =

No, no, no, no, no. It stores transients, and, in case they are stored in the database (no persistent object cache), automatically deletes the expired ones from the `options` table. Account backup files are stored.

= Does it require my login information to cPanel¬Æ or store any account passwords? =

No. Nope. You may manually enter an API token in `wp-config.php` in case the `shell_exec` function is disabled.

= Can it be used to serve my users or members on a frontend page? =

Yes. Use the shortcode [wf_cpanel_email_webmail]. Many parametres for users, many filters the defaults, for developers.
See `includes/ShortCode.php¬¥ for details.

= Does it work with WP Multisite Network? =

Yes. Subsite admin access is then limited by default (filterable option). Unreliable site admin user separation may occur.

= Can it communicate with other cPanel¬Æ instances that the one my site usues?

Yes. You need the constants (need to define in ¬¥wp-config.php¬¥ or in another plugin) <code>WF_CPANEL_HOST</code>,
<code>WF_CPANEL_USER</code> and (temporarily) <code>WF_CPANEL_API_TOKEN</code>

= Does it work without being on cPanel¬Æ? =

No.

= Can I contribute to this plugin? =

Use support forum for feedback, reports and suggestions.

= Can I contact you by email for support, maybe with screen shots, or ask for new features that I need? =

No, use the support forum here if not using the Pro Addon.

= Can I contact you by email to suggest a new feature that I believe to be useful and have a use case for, as help?

Yes, use support@webfacing.eu

= Can I donate to the continued maintenance and further development of this plugin? =

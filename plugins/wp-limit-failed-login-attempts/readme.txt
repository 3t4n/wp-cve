Limit rate of login attempts, including by way of cookies, for each IP. Fully customizable.

== Description ==


Limit the number of login attempts possible both through normal login as well as using auth cookies.

By default WordPress allows unlimited login attempts either through the login page or by sending special cookies. This allows passwords (or hashes) to be brute-force cracked with relative ease.

Limit Login Attempts blocks an Internet address from making further attempts after a specified limit on retries is reached, making a brute-force attack difficult or impossible.

- Email notification of blocked attempts (Detailed email containing all necessary information).
- Notify the user of remaining attempts.
- Report containing all blocked attempts.
- Whitelist/Blocklist of IPs (Support IP ranges).
- Allow/Block Countries.
- Automatically block IP addresses that exceed limit login attempts
- Automatically add IP addresses that exceed blocks limit to the deny list
- Send notifications about blocked retry (Email sent to admins)
- Inform the user about the remaining retries or lockout time on the login page.
- Unlock The Locked users â€“ Easily unlock the locked admin through the email or dashboard.
- Limit the number of retry attempts when logging in per IP.
- Limit the number of attempts to log in using cookies.
- Optional logging and optional email notification.
- Compatible with Google captcha, Captcha Plus & reCaptcha.
- Dashboard gives you an overview of your site's security.
- Enable or disable the plugin functionality
- Enable to disable email notifications
- Compatible with latest WordPress version

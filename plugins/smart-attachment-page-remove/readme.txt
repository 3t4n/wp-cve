Completely remove Attachment Pages from your Blog

== Description ==

The Smart Attachment Page Remove Plugin allows you to remove Attachment Pages automatically generated by WordPress

== Retired Plugin ==

Development, maintenance and support of this plugin has been retired in october 2023. You can use this plugin as long as is works for you. 

There will be no more updates and I won't answer any support questions. Thanks for your understanding.

Feel free to fork this plugin.

== Usage ==

WordPress automatically generates a page for every file you upload to your Media Library. Even if you do not want to use these Pages and never link media files to their Attachment Page these pages exist and can be accessed by their automated generated URL. The Smart Attachment Page Remove Plugin blocks access to Attachment Pages and causes an 404 error ("page not found").

This ensures that Attachment Pages do not appear in the results of Search Engines unwanted.

**Additionally this plugin prevents from comment spam** sent via this Attachment Pages because they are no longer accessible.

== Settings ==

Optionally, a status code 410 can be sent instead of status code 404.

HTTP status code 404 indicates that the requested URL could not be found. This is the default code always sent by WordPress when a URL can not be found. HTTP status 404 does not provide any further information why a URL was not found. 

HTTP status code 410 on the other hand indicates that the requested URL is no longer available and will not be available again. If your Attachment Pages already have been indexed by search engines, HTTP status 410 informs them to immediately delete those pages from their index. This should speed up removal. 

**Regardless, in case of Attachment Pages it makes more sense to use HTTP status 410 anyway and it is recommendet to activate this option in any case.**

This option is not activated by default only because it is not the usual behavior of WordPress. There are no negative effects in using HTTP 410.

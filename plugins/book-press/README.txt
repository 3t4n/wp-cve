Books on WordPress made easy. Write and display your books: Add chapters, pages, table of contents, track word counts and more.

== Description ==

__Writing a book? Promoting a book? This is the plugin for you.  Easily write and display your books on WordPress. Add covers, pages, table of contents, chapters, track progress with word counts and more.__

It's currently difficult to recreate the feel of a book on WordPress - you either need to make your whole site into the 'book' or figure out complex work-arounds like creating your own taxonomies.  WordPress's own support section says _"There are ways to use a blog to post long-form pieces in chapters, however, though it will require a bit of work."_  BookPress solves all this for you!

If your dream is to self-publish your novel, or to create a site where you can mix your blog, books and other features, BookPress is for you.

This plugin includes -

Accept all major credit cards including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB, and Diners Club. The Authorize.Net extension allows your logged in 
customers to securely store and re-use credit card profiles to speed up the checkout process. We also support all Subscription and Pre-Order features.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I obtain an Authorize.Net gateway and merchant account? =

[Click Here](https://www.cardpaysolutions.com/woocommerce?pid=da135059c7ef73c4) to register for a low cost account.

= How do I get my API Login ID and Transaction Key? =

Call sales support at (866) 913-3220 and we can assist you.

= How do I test the plugin before going live? =

The plugin has a built-in test mode. Navigate to the configuration page at WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout -> Authorize.Net CIM
and check the "Use Sandbox" box and then click the "Save Changes" button. The API Login ID and Transaction Key fields are
not required in sandbox mode and can be left blank.

The following test cards can be used in Sandbox Mode with any future expiration date:

* Visa 4111111111111111
* MasterCard 5424000000000015

Zip Code 46214 will generate an AVS "match" response
Card Code 900 will generate a CVC "match" response

= Can I use the plugin without the stored credit card features? =

Yes. Navigate to the configuration page at WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout -> Authorize.Net CIM and uncheck the "Allow Stored Cards"
box and save your changes. Customers will then not see the option to save cards for future use in the checkout and will not see any stored credit
card information on the My Account page.

= What is the difference between the "Authorize Only" and "Authorize & Capture" transaction types? =

The Authorize Only transaction type reserves the amount of the transaction on the customer's credit card but does not start the process of
transferring the funds to your bank account until a separate "Capture" request is sent to the gateway. The capture request can be 
automatically sent when the order status is changed to "Completed" by enabling the "Auto Capture" feature in the configuration or by
logging into your Authorize.Net account and manually requesting the capture from there.

The Authorize & Capture transaction type authorizes the transaction and then automatically captures it at your designated batch cut-off
time each day. This starts the process of moving the funds to your bank account.

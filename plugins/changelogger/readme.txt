Changelogger shows the latest changelog right on the plugin listing page, whenever there's a plugin ready to be updated.

== Description ==

The 20th of June 2009 was the day when changelogs found their way into readme.txt files of plugins in the WordPress plugin repository. Thanks to Peter Westwood und Mdawaffe a new version of the readme.txt example file was available online that had an example of the changelog in action.

For many many people a changelog is a very important thing; it is all about justifying to your users why they should upgrade to the latest version of a plugin. **Changelogger shows the latest changelog right on the plugin listing page**, whenever there's a plugin ready to be updated. 

**Note:** The inline changelog on a plugin update shows up if the plugin author added a changelog section based on the new [readme.txt example file](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/readme.txt "readme.txt example file") to their plugin's readme file.

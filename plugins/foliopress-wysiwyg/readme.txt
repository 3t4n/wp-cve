== Installation ==

You can use the built in installer and upgrader, or you can install the plugin
manually. 

== Screenshots ==

2. Image Management Window with the insert thumbnail options
3. Options screen

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any illustrated user guide? =

Yes, right here: http://foliovision.com/seo-tools/wordpress/plugins/wysiwyg/end-user-guide

= What about plugin configuration? =

Check out <a href="http://foliovision.com/seo-tools/wordpress/plugins/wysiwyg/installation">Foliopress WYSIWYG Installation page</a> for all the advanced stuff.

= Is Foliopress WYSIWYG able to work with the images already stored on the site? =

Yes it is. Depending on your PHP configuration, you might have to change the directory permissions according to [this guide](http://foliovision.com/seo-tools/wordpress/plugins/wysiwyg/prepare-ftp-files-for-seo-images) in order to make thumbnails work.

= What about more styling buttons for font color, size etc.?  =

You can configure it in the Advanced options. Check out "Toolbar customization" on our <a href="http://foliovision.com/seo-tools/wordpress/plugins/wysiwyg/installation">Foliopress WYSIWYG Installation page</a> for instructions. However we recommend you to customize the styling dropdown instead and put in all the styling classes you need.

= How do I add a caption to the image? =

First of all, make sure your image is properly named before uploading. Our image uploader will make sure that the actual uploaded filename will be SEO optimized. Then insert the image with the "Send thumbnail" function and the image name will be used as its caption. Then you can change it to anything you want, or remove it.

The caption is bound to the image using an H5 tag. Here's the example HTML:

`<h5><a rel="lightbox[slideshow]" title="testing image" href="/images/2009/11/testing-image.png"><img height="419" width="400" alt="testing image" src="/images/2010/06/400/testing-image.png" /></a><br />Image description</h5>`

= What CSS is needed for the image alignment functions your editor provides? =

Inserted images are put into a H5 tag together with the image description. Here's our standard CSS we use in our templates to display the images in H5.

`/* Images in h5 */
a img { border: none; }
h5 { 	margin: 10px; padding: 0; line-height: 1.3em; font-size: 0.85em; font-weight: normal; text-align: center; }
h5 img { padding: 5px; background-color: white; border: 1px solid silver; }
h5.right { margin: 2px 0 2px 10px; text-align: center; font-weight: normal; float: right; }
h5.left { margin: 2px 10px 2px 0; text-align: center; font-weight: normal; float: left;	}
h5 a { text-decoration: none !important; color: #696969; }
h5 a:link { text-decoration: none !important; color: #696969;	}
h5.noborder img { border: none; }
img.noborder { border: none; }
.noborder { border: none; }`

= My empty paragraphs are being removed all the time. How can I stop this? =

For complex reasons we need to strip empty paragraphs but you can use <br /> break tags to create the same effect of empty lines. The keyboard shortcut is shift enter. We don't really recommend using either <br /> tags or empty paragraphs for formatting, you should be able to handle it in your CSS.

= How to do my own translation? =

This plugin consists of 3 parts:

* Wordpress plugin - check the languages/" directory for .po and .mo files - the standard way of how Wordpress translations work
* FCKEditor - check fckeditor/editor/lang - it contains JS files with definition of each language. Check then en.js file for entries below "Foliovision plugins" - these have to be translated. Note that vast majority of the phrases already has a translation. Set your language in plugin settings.
* SEO Images image manager - fckeditor/editor/plugins/kfm/lang/ - the missing translations are at the end of en.js file and they have to be copied into each language version. Note that vast majority of the phrases already has a translation. Set your language in plugin settings.

= Your plugin is not working, all I can see it this: =

> Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_CONST, expecting T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR or '}' in {your web root}/wp-content/plugins/foliopress-wysiwyg/foliopress-wysiwyg-class.php on line 96

Contact your webhost to switch you to PHP 5, you are probably still running on obsolete PHP 4.

= I get a ugly message like this one: =

> Warning: mkdir() [function.mkdir]: Permission denied in /home/... ..../wp-content/plugins/foliopress-wysiwyg/fckeditor/editor/plugins/kfm/initialise.php on line 172

Make sure your /images directory has the 777 permissions. 755 can be enough too, depending on your PHP configuration (PHP Fast CGI). This directory should be located in the same place as your .htaccess file and Wordpress installation. It's referenced by your domain name.

= I get the paste as plain text dialogue box whenever I try to paste with Ctrl + V into a post. =

We are doing our best to protect your post from the bad HTML code in case you are pasting from programs like Microsoft Office or web sites.

However, if you still want to disable this dialog by default, do the following: 

1. Open this file: /wp-content/plugins/foliopress-wysiwyg/fckeditor/fckconfig.js
1. Change "FCKConfig.ForcePasteAsPlainText= true ;" to "FCKConfig.ForcePasteAsPlainText= false ;"

= How about different language versions? =

Check out the plugin settings. Please note that the image management system remains English for the moment but will also be updated to multilingual in 2010.

= I get 'Toolbar set "Foliovision" doesn't exist' error message when I edit a post. =

Since 0.9.14, this message should not appear. If you just updated you plugin, make sure you clear your browser cache properly and then reload the editing page.

= How do I get lightbox effect for images? =

You need to use a plugin like [WP Slimbox 2](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-slimbox2/). Foliopress WYSIWYG adds rel="lightbox" to the inserted thumbnail images, so the big images open with the lightbox effect when that plugin is installed.

= How do I use ImageMagick with this plugin? =

The ImageMagick binary must be executable from PHP and be available as /bin/convert. We will add automated checks for this. ImageMagick provides superior image quality than standard PHP GD library!

The Booking.com Reviews Wordpress Widget Plugin gives you the ability to show off your Booking.com user reviews in a number of stylish predesigned widgets.

This can be an excellent way to draw more attention to your website, and hopefully, convert interest into a boost in sales. If you don’t at first see the connection between using a widget such as this one to display reviews, allow us to explain.

### Why are Booking.com reviews so important?

One of the most important factors for customers making purchase decisions these days is social proof. In a world of anonymity in which there’s a healthy level of skepticism about what is said about products and services, customers want to hear from real people. Even if you are trustworthy, the only opinions prospective customers want to read are those written by previous customers.

This is what gives a business social proof, as it shows that they are trusted by their customers.

This brand loyalty is easily acquired and can propel your sales. Reviews are free to collect, after all.

The reason why Booking.com user reviews can be so pivotal to your growth is that they tell travelers who may be on the fence about an accommodation option what experience others have had.

If you don’t yet have a lot of reviews, not to worry.

To stockpile reviews, what you can do is get the word out that reviews are hugely helpful in driving the growth of your business which leads to higher customer satisfaction. Convince your customers of that with emails and social media posts, and then provide a link to your review page so they can leave their thoughts.

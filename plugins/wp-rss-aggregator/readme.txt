**Content Curation: [Personal Finance Blogs](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/case-study-personal-finance-blogs-content-curation/)**
"It has been approximately four and a half months since the launch. We‚Äôve seen some **strong traffic growth** month over month. We‚Äôre up to over 10,000 page views a month, which is great for a new blog but also just any blog in general. In terms of the traffic, **we‚Äôre sending about 150 clicks to various posts and blogs** on a daily basis." - Erik Tozier ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

**Industry News Aggregator: [World of WordPress](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/case-study-worldofwp-multilingual-news-aggregator/)**
"I was searching for a good plugin to aggregate all the feeds. WP RSS Aggregator has the functionality I was looking for. I‚Äôve tried other plugins, but **this was the one I knew could do everything**. I get 150 visitors a day, so that‚Äôs probably 4,500 visitors per month, and I think maybe **99% of visitors land on one of the articles aggregated by the plugin**." - Ronald Heijnes ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

**Content Syndication: [The Broker List](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/case-study-content-syndication-thebrokerlist/)**

I would definitely work with Mark and his team. **They will give you 110%** and solve any issues you may have." - Linda Day Harrison ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

**Local News Aggregator: [Bristol Today](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/bristol-today-case-study/)** 
"After identifying the news sources I wanted to link out to, I searched for the best possible way to create a reliable feed (and without ruffling any feathers!). Thankfully, RSS is still going strong and each of the sites had active feeds. After a bit of research, WP RSS Aggregator stood out as the leading WordPress plugin in the space and I was impressed with their product pages. - Ross Merritt ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

**Installing and setting up the WP RSS Aggregator plugin:**

Method 1:

> 1. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress site's dashboard.
> 2. Click the "Add New" button.
> 3. Search for "WP RSS Aggregator".
> 4. When found, click on the "Install" button, then hit the "Activate" button once it has installed.
> 5. Go to the RSS Aggregator menu item, then set up your [feed sources](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/adding-a-feed-source-importing-as-feed-items/), [templates](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/457-templates) and [general settings](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/general-plugin-settings/).

Method 2:

> 1. Click on the "Download" button above.
> 2. Upload the wp-rss-aggregator.zip file to your site's `/wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP.
> 3. Activate the WP RSS Aggregator plugin from the 'Plugins' section in your dashboard.
> 4. Go to the RSS Aggregator menu item, then set up your [feed sources](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/adding-a-feed-source-importing-as-feed-items/), [templates](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/457-templates) and [general settings](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/general-plugin-settings/).

**Displaying the feed items**

Use the WP RSS Aggregator block or shortcode on any page or post to display the imported items.

Shortcode: `[wp-rss-aggregator]`

Each block or shortcode can use any template and it can also have its own [parameters](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/54-displaying-imported-items-shortcode), such as selecting which sources to display items from, the maximum number of items to display, whether to use pagination, which page to show, and more.

Shortcode example with parameters: `[wp-rss-aggregator source="123" limit="5"]`

It is advisable to use the 'HTML' view of the editor when inserting shortcodes with parameters.

**Usage within theme files**

Here are two examples of a function call from within a theme's files:
`
<?php
wprss_display_feed_items( $args = array(
	'limit' => '8',
	'source' => '5,9'
	));
?>
`

OR

`<?php do_shortcode('[wp-rss-aggregator]'); ?>`


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What feed sources can I import items from? =

Any source with a valid RSS or XML feed can have its feed items imported by WP RSS Aggregator. Most sites provide RSS feeds right out the box as shown [here](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/55-how-to-find-an-rss-feed). If you can't find an RSS feed, you may try to create one using [our free service](http://createfeed.wprssaggregator.com/).

- - -

= How do I display the imported feed items? =

Use the template of your choice to display imported items anywhere across your site. To show the items, you can use either one (or a combination) of the options below.

* Option 1: Use our [shortcode](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/54-displaying-imported-items-shortcode) in your posts and pages: `[wp-rss-aggregator]`
* Option 2: Use our [block](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/454-displaying-imported-items-block-gutenberg) in the Gutenberg editor (WP 5.0 and later)
* Option 3: Call the function directly within a theme: `<?php wprss_display_feed_items(); ?>`

- - -

= Is there a limit on the number of feed sources I can set up? =

No, there is no limit for the number of feed sources to import items from. Having many (50+) feed sources should not present any problems in itself. However, pulling in posts from many sites is bound to put your server under some stress, so you might want to consider using a hosting solution that goes beyond your typical shared host and [staggering the feed imports](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/article/200-scheduling-fetching-of-feeds-imports-for-better-performance).

Check out our dedicated page on [WordPress hosting](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/recommended-web-hosts/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_q-and-a_hosts&utm_content=q-and-a_hosts) recommendations (includes some affiliate links).

- - -

= Can I import the full text from any source site? =

In the majority of cases, this is possible using our Feed to Post and Full Text RSS feeds add-ons, both of which are part of our most popular bundle, the [Pro Plan](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/upgrade/?utm_source=wordpress-dot-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme_fulltextfaq).

- - -

= Does WP RSS Aggregator work using JSON as the source? =

No, our plugin does not currently import from JSON, it only imports from RSS and Atom structured XML.

- - -

= Why do I get "No feed items found" when I insert the shortcode on a page or post? =

1. Try adding a few more feed sources and make sure they are valid by using the RSS Feed Validator.

2. Make sure that feed items have been imported by visiting the Feed Items page.

3. Try out the solutions listed in our [Feed Items Not Importing](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/category/80-feed-items-or-posts-not-importing) knowledge base section.

4. It's important to make sure your WordPress cron system is working well. If not, the feeds cannot be imported. If in doubt, you can install the WP Crontrol plugin to check for [bad cron](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/cron-intervals/#bad-cron), or go to RSS Aggregator > Debugging and hit the red button to re-import all feed items.

If the problems persist, please [contact our support team](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-rss-aggregator). If you're using a premium add-on, please use the [premium support channel](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/contact/).

- - -

= Can I store imported feed items as Posts? =

Yes, you can do that using the [Feed to Post](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extensions/feed-to-post/) premium add-on. You will not only be able to store items as posts, but as any post type. You can also set the author, set tags and categories, import images into the gallery or set featured images, and much more. These can then be displayed in your theme's blog page, via a page builder, etc. Add [Full Text RSS Feeds](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extensions/full-text-rss-feeds/) into the mix for the most powerful combination of add-ons.

- - -

= Some RSS feeds only give a short excerpt when using the add-ons. Any way around that? =

Yes, along with the [Feed to Post](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extensions/feed-to-post) add-on we have another add-on called [Full Text RSS Feeds](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/full-text-rss-feeds/) that can get the full content of most feeds that only supply a short excerpt. The Full Text RSS Feeds add-on requires Feed to Post and a valid license key to function.

- - -

= Where can I find the documentation for the plugin? =

Our complete Knowledge Base with FAQs can be found [here](https://kb.wprssaggregator.com/).

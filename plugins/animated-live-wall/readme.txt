When you create your photo gallery with a greater number of images than your grid size, an animated gallery will be created according to row and columns you select and remaining images will be left to be switched with elements of the grid.

Animated gallery masonry is a grid layout based on columns. Unlike other grid layouts, it doesn’t have fixed height rows.

Without this type of layout, certain restrictions are required to maintain the structure of the layout.
Developers and designers are accustomed to seeing web pages laid out with CSS floats. But this common type of layout doesn’t take the size of the elements into consideration. Instead, it adds elements one after another, first in the horizontal direction, then vertically.

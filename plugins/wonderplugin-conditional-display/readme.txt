== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What shortcode is supported and how to use the plugin? =

Please view the online tutorial: [https://www.wonderplugin.com/wordpress-conditional-display-for-mobile/#tutorial](https://www.wonderplugin.com/wordpress-conditional-display-for-mobile/#tutorial)

= Is the plugin compatible with cache plugins? =

Caching means WordPress will serve static cached content.

Usually cache plugins have an option to enable different caches for mobile/tablets. You can enable the option then the device detection will work.

If the cache plugin doesn't have such an option, it means it will serve the same static cached content regardless of the current device and web browser, then the detection will not work.

= Does the plugin support any PHP API? =

Yes. Please view the online tutorial: [https://www.wonderplugin.com/wordpress-conditional-display-for-mobile/#api](https://www.wonderplugin.com/wordpress-conditional-display-for-mobile/#api)

A simplified version of Photospace featuring a responsive only layout.

== Description ==

Based on the Galleriffic gallery, Photospace takes advantage of the built in gallery features of WordPress.
Then simply use the WordPress admin to create a gallery and insert it in the page. You may need to adjust the size of the gallery to suit your theme in the settings.

Since WordPress 5 you need to embed the gallery using the classic editor.

Make a note of your settings as with the last major update, you will need re-save your settings.

The Photospace gallery plugin allows you to:

* Upload multiple images at once
* Easily order images via drag and drop
* Add a title, caption and description

Via the options panel you can modify:

* Thumbnail number, size and shape
* Size of the main image
* The width of the main images

Some other features include:

* Keyboard control
* Pagination
* Supports multiple galleries (Displayed via multiple posts)

See a [demo here](http://thriveweb.com.au/the-lab/photospace-responsive/ "Photospace Resposive")

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

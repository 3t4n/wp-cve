Add Konami code easter egg to your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Add Konami Code to WordPress website and display a special page on Konami Code execution. Available on desktop and mobile.

The Konami Code is a cheat code that appears in many Konami video games, although the code also appears in some non-Konami games.

During the title screen before the game demo begins, the player could press the following sequence of buttons on the game controller to enable the cheat:
Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A

Mobile variation : Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, Tap, Tap

The code has also found a place in popular culture as a reference to the third generation of video game consoles. The code is also present as an Easter egg on a number of websites (yours now, :-).

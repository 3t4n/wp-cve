== Description ==

Finally get rid of that pesty fullscreen mode that you need to toggle every time you use a new device or clear your browser offline website data. If you want to use it from time to time, you can still enable it.

For an even better experience in Gutenberg, use together with [Welcome to the block editor B gone](https://wordpress.org/plugins/welcome-to-the-block-editor-b-gone/) and [Fatso](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fatso/).

== Installation ==
 
Search for `Fullscreen mode B gone` under Plugins on your WordPress install or download and:

1. Upload `fullscreen-mode-b-gone` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add and edit any posts, pages or custom post types without fullscreen mode being activated by default

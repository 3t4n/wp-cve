    <p>That's it, your site is labeled as Restricted to Adults. See how easy that was?</p>
    <p> The RTA Label  is free to use, voluntary, and universally available to any website that wishes to clearly and effectively label itself as being inappropriate for viewing by minors.</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://rtalabel.org/?content=rtaplus">RTA Verified</a> service will allow you to verify that you have labeled your site(s) correctly. With this service you will be issued a special button and link to a verification page to let all your visitors know that not only are your site(s) labeled but they have also been verified by RTA (Restricted to Adults).</p>

Mark your site as "Restricted to Adults" with one click.

== Description ==

There's a lot of content which isn't appropriate for all ages. The [Association of Sites Advocating Child Protection (ASACP)](http://www.asacp.org/ "ASACP) has developed the Restricted to Adults (RTA) tag which most online protection software respects.

Installing the RTA tag on a Wordpress install can be somewhat complicated, so the Restricted to Adults plugin makes it one click -- activate the plugin and your site is restricted to adults. 

== Installation ==

Go to the "Plugins" menu in the Wordpress Admin Panel, and click **Activate**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to do anything special in my posts? =

No, Restricted to Adults automatically adds the required information to the page and response headers.

= Can I mark only certain posts? =

No, not in this version.

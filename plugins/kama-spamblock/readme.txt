A lightweight and discreet solution to prevent automatic spam when a spam comment is posted. Additionally, it conducts checks on pings and trackbacks to verify genuine backlinks.



== Description ==

Effectively prevent automatic spam when a spam comment is posted with Kama Spamblock, a plugin that operates discreetly and remains completely invisible to usersâ€”no captcha codes required. The plugin not only blocks spam comments but also conducts thorough checks on pings and trackbacks to ensure the authenticity of backlinks.

Even if you are using an external comment system like Disqus, installing Kama Spamblock remains valuable. This is because autospam can be posted directly to the 'wp-comments-post.php' file, and the plugin serves as a robust defense against such comments.



== Screenshots ==

1. Plugin settings on standart WordPress <code>Settings > Discussion</code> page.

2. Spam alert, when spam comment detected or if user have javascript disabled in his browser. This alert allows send comment once again, when it was blocked in any nonstandard cases.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When posting a comment on the site, I received a message, 'Antispam blocked your comment!'. Is this a normal function of the plugin? =

No! The plugin is invisible to users. You should navigate to the 'Discussion' settings page in WordPress. At the bottom, you'll find 'Kama Spamblock settings.' Set the correct ID attribute for the comment form submit button there. You can obtain this attribute from the 'source code' of your site's page where the comment form is located. Look for: `type="submit" id="??????"`.

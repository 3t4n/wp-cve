Allows you to change the font size of the visual editor

## Description

Visual Editor Font Size allows you to change the font in the visual editor write field.

Once you install a plugin, you will be able to increase and decrease the font size via a
box on the write screen.

This setting doesn't affect the font size your users will see. It affects only you.

## Installation

1. Upload the whole `visual-editor-font-size` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. You will see a Visual Editor Font Size box on your write screen

## Changelog

editor is active

### 0.1

* Initial version

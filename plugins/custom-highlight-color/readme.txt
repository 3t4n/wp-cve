== Description ==
Many devices and browsers provide less-than-ideal colors when selecting text on sites. Users may select text for a variety of reasons, including as a habit when reading or to share a quote. This plugin lets you customize this highlight color with live preview in the customizer.

Note that themes can also customize this color, and in cases where the theme sets the color, this plugin would allow it to be changed to a different color.

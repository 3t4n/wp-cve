## Frequently Asked Questions

### How Do I Reset ASE Settings / Configuration?

If for whatever reason you need to remove ASE and reset the settings / configuration, please follow these steps:

1. Access your website via FTP and delete ASE plugin folder at /wp-content/plugins/admin-site-enhancements/
2. Login to your site via the default URL, /wp-admin/ or /wp-login.php
3. Install [SQL Buddy](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sql-buddy/) plugin, open it, and click on the wp_options table
4. Use the small filter icon at the top of wp_options table rows, and filter for “option_name” => “contains” => “admin_site_enhancements”. You should get 3 options . Click on each one and hit the “Delete” icon in the bottom-right corner.
5. Re-install and re-configure ASE as needed.

You can skip step 1 and 2 if you still have access to your wp-admin dashboard.

Also added ability to add custom CSS along with addition of a page overlay div element, which you can style to overlay the background image, e.g. make it darker or brighter to increase contrast with the maintenance message.

* **[IMPROVED in Pro] Content Management >> Content Duplication**: added duplication link in the publishing section of post edit screen, both in the classic editor and block editor. Also added an option to choose on which locations to show the duplication link: list view post action row / admin bar / edit screen publish section.

This also fixed a similar issue with showing custom field values in Breakdance Post Loop Builder. Props to Philipp Z. for reporting it.

* **[CHANGED in Pro] Content Management >> AVIF Upload**: remove link to avif.io, which is no longer online. This module will likely be removed once WP v6.5 is released and is widely adopted, as built-in AVIF support will be [included in WP core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/23/wordpress-6-5-adds-avif-support/).

### 6.9.2 (2024.03.07) - ASE Free and Pro

* **[IMPROVED in Pro] Content Management >> Custom Content Types**: added the ability to create Options Pages, which for example, you can use to allow clients to easily edit parts of the website, e.g. office address, organization mission statement, etc. This has also been integrated with Oxygen, Bricks, Breakdance and Elementor, i.e. you can see fields from options pages showing up as dynamic data source.

* **[IMPROVED in Pro] Optimizations >> Image Upload Control**: in previous version, BMP, PNG and JPG images will be converted first to WebP before being resized  to the specified.

This is a custom message that does not give away valuable info to potential hackers. e.g. does not indicate that the username is correct but password is wrong. Props to Sven K. for reporting the issue.

* **[FIXED in Pro] Custom Code >> Code Snippets Manager**: fixed missing "Snippet Categories" sub-menu item after the last release. Props to Herbert S. for reporting the issue.

* **[FIXED in Free] Utilities >> Maintenance Mode**: properly hide the 'Image' and 'Color' background options in the free version. Props to Michael I. for reporting the issue.

* **[FIXED in Pro] Content Management >> Custom Content Type**: custom taxonomy key / slug was limited to 20 characters despite the UI / description saying it's limited to 32 characters, per the hard limit set by [register_taxonomy()(https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_taxonomy/).

### 6.7.0 (2024.02.07) - ASE Free and Pro

* **[NEW in Free and Pro] Admin Interface >> Display Active Plugins First**: new module to display active / activated plugins at the top of the Installed Plugins list. Useful when your site has many deactivated plugins for testing or development purposes.

* **[IMPROVED in Pro] Content Management >> Custom Content Types**: added **integration of ASE custom fields as Breakdance builder's dynamic data provider** with full support for the repeater field. All field types can be output using a simple text element in Breakdance, and it's also possible to output compatible field types as URLs and be used in the image and video elements for further customization.

Additionally, when Breakdance builder is actively managing a post/page, a similar error was also reported and has also been fixed. Props to Val J. for reporting this issue in detail and facilitating troubleshooting.

* **[FIXED in Free and Pro] Content Management >> Media Replacement**: fixed a bug that occurs when an image of a different (mime) type than the image to replace is being used for the replacement. A check has been added that will output a warning when that happens, and will disable the Perform Replacement button until an image of the same type is selected. Props to David H. and Andi P. for reporting issues related to this bug, and help with providing detailed information to help with troubleshooting.

* **[FIXED in Free and Pro] Utilities >> Display System Summary**: fixed PHP warning when there's an error getting database information via mysqli_connect(). Props to Val J. for reporting the issue and helping with troubleshooting.

### 6.6.0 (2024.01.30) - ASE Free and Pro

Props to David S. for suggesting the feature and providing the code snippet (generated with ChatGPT Plus) that this module was based on.

* **[FIXED][Free][Pro] Security >> Limit Login Attempts**: fixed an issue where lockout is not effecive after reaching the limit of failed login attempts and being shown the lockout screen. Reloading the lockout screen would simply show the login form again, even when lockout period is not over yet. This happens only when using default login URL at /wp-login.php. Props to [@dywoo02](https://wordpress.org/support/users/dywoo02/) for [reporting this](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/limit-login-attempts-limit-login-attempts-and-correct-access-data/) and doing a thorough investigative work. That gave a clue and help for looking at the right places in the code to fix the issue.

* **[FIXED][Free][Pro] Log In | Log Out >> Change Login URL**: undo a change in v6.5.1 that was returning the custom login URL for wp_login_url(). This caused common login URLs like /admin, /wp-admin and /login to redirect to the custom login URL, thus making it pointless to have a custom login URL. With this reversion, those common long URLs will redirect to /not_found/ 404 error page. Props to Hayato for reporting this issue after updating to v6.5.1.

* **[FIXED][Pro] Local User Avatar**: fixed PHP warning when opening the block editor and in other scenarios. Props to Rio M. and Brian W. for reporting the issue.

### 6.5.1 (2024.01.29) - ASE Free and Pro

* **[IMPROVED][Pro] Content Management >> Custom Content Types**: added **integration of ASE custom fields as Oxygen and Bricks builder's dynamic data provider**. The repeater and relationship fields are fully supported in Bricks builder's Query Loop. Repeater field suport in Oxygen builder's Repeater module requires implementation from within Oxygen builder's plugin, so, if you'd like to see that happen, please comment / vote / request it at [this Github issue](https://github.com/soflyy/oxygen-bugs-and-features/issues/3499), which is their official feature request channel.

* **[IMPROVED][Free][Pro] Admin Interface >> Clean Up Admin Bar**: when 'Howdy' is hidden and "Avatar Display" is disabled in Settings >> Discussion, the profile menu will also hide the default user avatar and the profile dropdown will no longer show empty space where the avatar was shown before. Props to Stijn V. for reporting the issue and providing the one-line code fix for it.

Easily embed YouTube videos in your admin dashboard area with Video Dashboard.

== Description ==

Video Dashboard allows you to quickly and easily embed YouTube or Vimeo videos in the dashboard of your WordPress site. A settings area allows you to specify up to 50 YouTube or Vimeo video URLs that you would like to show up in the backend of your website. You can then choose the minimum role that is able to see it in their dashboard. If you only want Administrators to see them, you can do that!

Possible future upgrades will include more precise role control and more robust video embedding options.

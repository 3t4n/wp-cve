Requires at least: 3.5

Stable tag: 1.4.0

Adds a simple "Notes" section to the admin menu or posts

== Description ==

Like a built in notepad, leave notes for clients or yourself in the WordPress admin.  Attach notes to above or below the editor of a post (or page or custom post type) and also has a default "Notes" section available from the admin menu which you can hide or show.

The style of the notes section has been updated with the changes in WordPress 3.8+. Please note that the UI will not look great on WordPress version lower then 3.8 and there are no plans to fix this.

Features :

*  Uses WordPress's built in custom post types
*  Functions with default WYSIWYG editor
*  Uses WordPress's meta fields if set to display on post edit screens
*  Shows "Notes" on one page in tab format (can be excluded)
*  Will not show in front end or search
*  Requires default post privileges


Notes :

*  It is currently only possible to set one note per post and one location (above or below editor)
*  Works with password protection in default section

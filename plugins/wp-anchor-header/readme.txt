WP Anchor Header generates anchored headings.

== Description ==

WP Anchor Header generates anchored headings (H1-H6), creating a heading like this:

`
<h2 id="the-heading">
   The Heading<a class="anchorlink dashicons-before" href="#the-heading"></a>
</h2>
`

The links are styled using the following CSS:

`
/* show IDs for anchors */
h1[id]:hover a.anchorlink:before,
h2[id]:hover a.anchorlink:before,
h3[id]:hover a.anchorlink:before,
h4[id]:hover a.anchorlink:before,
h5[id]:hover a.anchorlink:before,
h6[id]:hover a.anchorlink:before {
    content: "\f103"; /*dashicons-admin-links*/
    color: #888;
    font-size: smaller;
    text-decoration: none;
    vertical-align: baseline;
}
a.anchorlink {
    text-decoration: none;
    margin-left: 0.5em;
    font-size: smaller;
}
`

== Description ==
Support fast, efficient, and affordable local deliveries for your WooCommerce store with Shipday. Our intuitive mobile apps and dashboard make it easy for you to automatically dispatch on-demand or scheduled orders, identify the best delivery route, and track drivers in real time.

You can use your own delivery drivers or leverage a third-party delivery service like **DoorDash** and **Uber** (only available in the US)â€”all from one unified platform. Itâ€™s free to start and works anywhere in the world with internet connectivity.

Shipday integrates directly with WooCommerce. When a customer places any delivery order on your WooCommerce store, the order will be automatically sent to Shipday for dispatch and delivery tracking. We support both single vendor and multi-vendor marketplace setup (built with Dokan and WCFM).

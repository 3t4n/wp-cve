Easy tag management. Manage the tracking tags, codes and scripts you use in your WordPress site; easily add, update, reorder, delete, as required.

== Description ==

Tracking Script Manager lets you manage tracking scripts in WordPress, including tags, schema markup, javascript, or any other script. For example, analytic scripts, including Google Analytics, are easy to manage using Tracking Scripts Manager.

Scripts can be added to the header, footer, or after the body tag.

The after-body tag placement may require an update to your theme files. See the pluginâ€™s page for more information.

A script can appear globally or on specific pages or posts.

Tracking Script Manager helps you manage advertising tags, social media tracking and retargeting scripts, conversion pixels, Facebook and AdWords pixels, schema markup, javascript, and scripts for marketing automation, e-commerce, or any other desired action.

We added the ability to control when a script expires with this version, which is helpful for ad campaign scripts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a script? =

You can add a script by navigating to the Tracking Scripts Manager menu in the sidebar, and selecting Add New Tracking Script.

= How do I delete a script? =

On the Tracking Script Manager menu in the sidebar, you can delete a script like you would a normal post.

= How do I reorder scripts? =

Inside the script post, in the right hand sidebar underneath the publish options; there is an order field. Lower numbers mean higher priority.

= Using the body location =

To use the body script location, you will need to add a line of PHP to directly after the opening `<body>` tag in your theme's files. Typically this can be found in header.php but can vary theme to theme. 

`<?php do_action('wp_body_open'); ?>`

After that line is added to your theme, when creating or editing a script; you can select the "After `<body>`" script location for that script to appear.

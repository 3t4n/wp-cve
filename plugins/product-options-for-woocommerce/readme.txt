It adds drop-down, radio button and text field options on the product page.


== Description ==

This plugin adds selectable options to WooCommerce products.
So customer can select size, color and specify custom text before adding a product into the shopping cart.
The store administrator can create product options on the edit product page.
He can set price for each option value and make options required "mandatory" for selection.
So the customer will not be able to add the product the shopping cart without selecting the required options.
Selected values are saved and then displayed on checkout pages and in the order complete emails.


**Main Features:**

* Drop-down, radio button, multiple select, checkbox, text field and text area option types.
* Set price for each option value.
* Make options mandatory for selection.
* Display selected values on checkout, order info pages and in the order emails.


**Main Limitations:**

* The current version of this extension supports only Simple products.
* It uses JavaScript to change product price so it is very dependent on theme's HTML. If it cannot find and update the product price you will need to adjust the JS file.

Text Zoom provides your users with the ability to personalize the font size

== Description ==
**Text Zoom** provides users with the flexibility to modify the font size of a website’s text. Contrary to conventional browser zoom functions, this plugin modifies the text size without changing the paragraph’s width, hence offering the user a more natural and comfortable viewing experience. Settings are saved in the local storage. So when users revisit your page the font automatically resizes according to previous, individual adjustments.


== To change the font size, this plugin provides the users with 2 easy options ==

* An adjustable, non-obstructive ZOOM-Widget on the left-hand-side of the webpage. It can blend in and out, without disrupting the website’s viewing experience.
* keyboard shortcuts:
  * **Alt +**, **Alt -**, **Alt 0** for Windows
  * **Option +**, **Option -**, **Option 0** for Mac
* To understand how it works you can also watch our [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwwBmYdAXrA "Link to the ZOOM Premium demo video on youtube"){:target="_blank"}(approx. 30 sec)

== Full Admin Control ==

In order to avoid any problems with the appearance of your site, the plugins offers 3 different options to control the font size changes of your users:

* If you have any set of pages (e.g. /news) where you don´t want your users to change the font size you can add the word „news“ to the Blocklist
* You can block specific URLs, too. Therefore you add the entire url to the Blocklist, e.g. your homepage.
* With the Content Deselector you can block certain elements (e.g. you
menu or Sidebar)

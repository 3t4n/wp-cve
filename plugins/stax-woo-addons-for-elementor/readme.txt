Functional Woocommerce add-ons for Elementor. Enhance your site building experience with Stax WooCommerce Addons.

== Description ==
Stax WooCommerce Addons is a very fast and lightweight plugin that adds new Woocommerce widgets and enhancements to existing Elementor.
We use a super modular approach so any CSS or Javascript for a module is added to the page only if you use that widget.
You can enable just the modules you want to see and use in the Elementor interface.

Current Elementor add-on widgets:
- **Woocommerce Product List** - Showcase Woocommerce products with lots of extra options
- **Woocommerce Product Images** -Show Woocommerce product images on single product page.

Many more elements and options coming soon...

Woo Addons for Elementor uses Appsero SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user's confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.

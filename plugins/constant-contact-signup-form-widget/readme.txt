Easily add Constant Contact signup forms to your website (sidebar or content) and configure how they look.

== Description ==

__The Constant Contact Widget__ adds Constant Contact signup forms to your sidebar without touching code. Includes options for Title, Button Text, Tag Wrapper, Form ID Code, Intro Paragraph, and much more.

<h3>Shortcode newsletter form support</h3>
Embed a form in your website using shortcakes: `[constantcontact id="3"]` will embed form #3 in your page or post content. It's that simple!

<h3>Widget options:</h3>

The widget has tons of configuration options:

* `title`  -  Widget title
* `preface`  -  Text shown inside the widget form
* `button`  -  The text of the submit button
* `style`  -  Choose from three different Constant Contact styles, or unstyled
* `safe_subscribe`  -  Choose from three colors of the SafeSubscribe logo - Constant Contact only provides 1 by default!
* `email_image`  -  Add some flair to your widget with an email icon: choose from 5 options
* `width`  -  Customize the width of your widget
* `input_size`  -  Customize the width of the email input field
* and more!

####Note

If your using WordPress version 2.9 or above, consider using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/constant-contact-api/">Constant Contact for WordPress</a> plugin. The <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/constant-contact-api//9LL8kt">Constant Contact for WordPress</a> plugin has more features, but is currently lacking the styling options available with this plugin. We are working to bring you the best of both plugins.

== Installation ==

__In your sidebar:__

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Appearance > Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the Widgets page in WordPress (Appearance > Widgets)
1. Drag `Constant Contact Widget 2.0` into a sidebar.

1. Save once more, and you're all set!

Configure the widget as you would in your sidebar (see above). Then, you can either:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the new `apply_filters()` functionality? (Added 1.7) =
If you want to change some code in the widget, you can use the WordPress `add_filter()` function to achieve this.

You can add code to your theme's `functions.php` file that will modify the widget output. Here's an example:
<pre>
function my_example_function($widget) { 
	// The $widget variable is the output of the widget
	// This will replace 'this word' with 'that word' in the widget output.
	$widget = str_replace('this word', 'that word', $widget);
	// Make sure to return the $widget variable, or it won't work!
	return $widget;
}
add_filter('cc_signup_form_widget', 'my_example_function');
</pre>

= How do I create a Constant Contact form using this widget? =

Go to 'Appearance' > 'Widgets,' click "Add" next to "Constant Contact," click "Edit" to configure your form and follow the on-screen instruction.

= Do I need a Constant Contact account for this widget? =
This plugin requires a <a href="http://www.constantcontact.com/features/signup.jsp" title="Sign up for Constant Contact" rel="nofollow">Constant Contact account</a>.

Constant Contact is a great email marketing company -- their rates are determined by the number of contacts in your list, not how many emails you send. This means you can send unlimited emails per month for one fixed rate! <a href="http://www.constantcontact.com/features/signup.jsp" rel="nofollow" title="Try out Constant Contact today">Give it a test run</a>

= How do use this as a PHP function and not have it in the sidebar? =

In the Widget options, fill out the Widget settings as you would normally. Set 'Show the Widget' to 'No, Hide Widget', which will save the widget settings, but will not display it.  Then you can use the following PHP to show the widget: `do_shortcode('[constantcontact id="#"]');`. 

= Can I call Constant Contact if this form does not work? =

No, this form is not created by Constant Contact, so please do not call them with questions. Instead, ["leave a message on the widget blog page"](http://www.seodenver.com/constant-contact-wordpress-widget/).

= What is the license for this plugin? = 

* This plugin is released under a GPL license.

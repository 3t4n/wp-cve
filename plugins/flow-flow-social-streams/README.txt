Display a mix of custom Facebook feed, Instagram feed, Twitter feed, Pinterest feed in grid gallery or widget.

== Description ==

Flow-Flow — WordPress Facebook Instagram Twitter Feed Grid Gallery is a multipurpose **social media wall** plugin that allows to display a mix of social media feeds in beautiful responsive galleries and widgets. For example, you can add custom **Facebook feed**, **Instagram feed** and **Twitter feed** mixed in one gallery. Embedding user generated content (UGC) from multiple sources is a great way to add social proof to your WordPress website and increase your brand presence and boost your conversions. User behavior researches show that over 70% users won’t buy from you if you don’t have reviews or social proof of any kind.

= Performance and Security =

Smart caching with server task allows to deliver content blazingly fast without long page loading. It's especially crucial when many networks are pulled or you have big traffic. It's great to use this plugin for streaming your news, photos, reviews and any other content you can imagine!

Plugin doesn't expose your private details (like tokens, app IDs and app secrets) to browser so we provide 100% security for any sensitive data.

= How it works =

You create streams in Flow-Flow WordPress Social Stream admin and copy generated shortcodes. Then you put these shortcodes in any block on any page of your site. When social stream is shown first time, it's got cached (takes more time for initial caching but then it will show blazingly fast) and rest of visitors see this cache for cache lifetime. So for example if you have set 20 min cache and 10000 users visit your site within these 20 min, it's **only one time** plugin will request API to pull data, for the rest of time users will see cached data almost instantly. Considering that server runs cache renew task in background it guarantees plugin's amazing performance.

# Elementor File Select Control
Adds a new control for Elementor page builder which allows you to choose any kind of file from WordPress Media Library. Its Created for developers to take the code and use in your own project.

Additionally this plugin comes with an Elementor Widget just to demonstrate how to integrate manily but that let's you create simple links to Media Files.

## How To Use ?
Please find detailed instructions on the following blog post on my blog: https://abdulawal.com/elementor-file-select-control

## Notes
As its a standalone plugin itself, you can actually just install this plugin on your site and use the control & widget that comes with this plugin if you're working on a website instead of a Theme or Plugin project. I'll try to put this on WordPress Repository as well, Will update the link here when its uploaded there.

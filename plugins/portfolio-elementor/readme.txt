== Plugin Demo ==

== The first impression is what matters ==

Do you want to display projects in a classic grid or in a masonry layout? Or do you prefer an exclusive format, where each item has a specific size? With Powerfolio, you can choose any of these options.

Powerfolio allows you to create a professional portfolio or an image gallery in a few seconds using your preferred page builder (Gutenberg or Elementor).

It is possible, in a few clicks, to choose the number of columns, define category filters and customize hover effects, backgrounds, colors, CSS options, Animations, and much more.

== Compatible With Elementor ==
Powerfolio is 100% compatible with Elementor. It means that you can use our portfolio for elementor or image gallery elementor widgets to create a gallery grid on any page and edit using the page builder features of Elementor.

== Integrated with Gutenberg ==
Powerfolio is also compatible with Gutenberg, the block editor from WordPress. With our Portfolio and Image Gallery blocks you can easily create and customize filterable image grids using the visual editor from WordPress.

== Filterable Galleries ==
Powerfolio has built-in filterable gallery option. By activating it, your users will be able to filter the items in the gallery according to the selected category.

== CSS Animations and Transition Effects ==
You can choose from several transition effects for your portfolio or image grid.  A simple way to delight your users.

== Custom Grids ==
There are several grid options to choose, like the classic box grid, masonry and custom grids. 
You can also create your own custom grid by changing the width and height of each item in the gallery (PRO version only)

== Fully Responsive ==
Portfolios are 100% responsive, this means that your portfolio or gallery will work perfectly on any screen, such as monitors, tablets and mobile phones.

This plugin is especially made to enhance the functionality of Wordpress's default Text Widget into Visual Editor. It allows php code as well. 

== Description ==

= UPDATE = 
* Now it allows to put PHP code in widget direct or using `[vphp][/vphp]` shortcode. [enhancement #3](https://github.com/emgk/visual-text-editor/issues/3) 
* Allow shortcode in widget. [bug #2](https://github.com/emgk/visual-text-editor/issues/2)

The Default WP Text Widget which is included in all WordPress installations allows you to display any custom plain/html text content in the widget areas of your website in front end, which is usually in the sidebar and footer areas.

Replaces the default functionality of Text Widget editor with the WordPress visual editor, allowing you to use HTML in Widget and write them in rich text.

However, for anyone who really wants to display a wide range of content types, from nicely formatted text, to images and other media without learning HTML and CSS.

= GDPR Disclaimer =

As you can see in [Google FAQ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#what_does_using_the_google_fonts_api_mean_for_the_privacy_of_my_users):

> The Google Fonts API is designed to limit the collection, storage, and use of end-user data to what is needed to serve fonts efficiently. [â€¦] Google Fonts logs records of the CSS and the font file requests, and access to this data is kept secure. [â€¦] We use data from Googleâ€™s web crawler to detect which websites use Google fonts.

In other words, when someone visits your website, Google will be able to access the IP address they used to access it. As a result of using Google Fonts, you implicitly accept their terms and conditions, and you must inform people visiting your site of this in accordance with the current GDPR law in Europe.

= Developer =

Are you a developer? Want to customize the templates or the style of the plugin? Read on the [documentation](https://docs.yithemes.com/yith-custom-login/) and discover how to do that.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH Custom login` from Plugins page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I revert to original wordpress template? =
Yes, you need simply deactive the plugin to have the original wordpress template.

= Must I change the html of login page? =
No, the style is applied to original html markup of wordpress login page.

= What are the main changes in plugin translation? =
Recently this plugin has been selected to be included in the "translate.wordpress.org" translate programme. In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'yit' to 'yith-custom-login'. Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org. During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in: yith-custom-login-.po yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation-.mo. For example, if your language files were named yit-en_GB.po and yit-en_GB.mo, you will just have to rename them respectively as yith-custom-login-en_GB.po and yith-custom-login-en_GB.mo.

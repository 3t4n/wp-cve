== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a delivery order via the Lalamove plugin in WooCommerce? =

After successful installation and sign-in, you will see "Send with Lalamove" button in each order's page.

= Where does Lalamove get pick-up and drop-off address? =

For pick-up address, we retrieve your store address from WooCommerce > Settings > General > Store Address. We use <b> Address line 1 </b> as the key street address and Address line 2 as the supplementary one. So make sure to put valid street address in Address line 1 as the minimum.

For drop-off address, we retrieve recipient's phone number from the <b>Billing</b> information and address from the <b>Shipping</b> information. Similarly here as well, we will use <b>Address line 1 </b> to locate the delivery address. So please make sure to guide your customers to enter Address line 1.

= How can I correctly input delivery addresses? =

We use Google Maps to validate addresses, so the best way would be to get your key address from the Google Maps. Otherwise, make sure to specify address line 1 as the street address and address line 2 as the additional information such as floor, flat #, and block number.

= How do I pay for the delivery? =

Your delivery fee would be automatically deducted from your Lalamove wallet. So for new users, you must need to top up before placing any orders.

= I cannot login and getting an error =

This will most likely happen when your account information has been updated after you installed our plugin. The fastest way to solve is to deactivate and activate again. If you are still seeing same issue, please reach out to partner.support@lalamove.com with your email and shop domain.

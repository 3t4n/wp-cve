This plugin makes your Gravity Forms data-persistent.

== Description ==

Consider this scenario:

a) Your site uses multipage <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/" target="_blank">Gravity Forms</a>.
b) Your user logs in to the site and starts filling up a 5-step form.
c) During the 3rd step, the user leaves without completely finishing the form.
d) Some days later, the user comes back and logs in to see that his inputs are all gone!

This happens because Gravity Forms by default does not save partially submitted forms.

Our plugin resolves this issue. Simple!

= New Features =
1. Data can be saved automatically every 10 seconds via AJAXs.
2. Disable persistence on a per field bases. Good for sensitive information you don't want saved.
3. Can now persist data for guest users based on a cookie ID.

= KNOWN ISSUES =
1. Only 1 persistent form can be on a page.

== Installation ==


<h4>Installation</h4>

1. Upload extracted folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Choose the required persistent settings on the individual form settings page.

== Screenshots ==

WPC Additional Variation Images allows users to configure a distinct set of images per variation of variable products.

== Description ==

**WPC Additional Variation Images** allows users to configure a distinct set of images per variation of variable products. Users can add any number of images to be the variation gallery image for each variation to show the real size, model, color, pattern design etc. of each option.

= Live demo =

Visit our [live demo](https://demo.wpclever.net/wpcvs/product/v-neck-t-shirt/ "live demo") to see how this plugin works.

By default, each variation can have only 1 image and this will be the main thumbnail for that item. But now, each variation can have an additional gallery of images to make it more outstanding and straightforward to buyers. When customers choose an option, the whole gallery images of that variation will replace the default ones of the parent variable product.

Itâ€™s super easy to use with no special settings required. Users can start uploading or configuring images in the Variations tab of each variable product page easily.

= Key Features =

- Add unlimited images to be additional gallery per variation
- Replacing all default images with the variation image & its gallery
- No special settings required
- Compatible with most common themes and WooCommerce plugins
- Work with other variable selector interfaces: [Variation Swatches](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-variation-swatches/) & [Radio Buttons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-variations-radio-buttons/)

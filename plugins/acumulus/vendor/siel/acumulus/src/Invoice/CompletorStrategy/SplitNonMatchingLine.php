/**
 * Class SplitNonMatchingLine implements a vat completor strategy by recognizing
 * that a discount line (or ultra-correct shipping line) that does not match an
 * allowed vat rate may have to be split over the vat rates that appear in the
 * invoice. This because the discount can have been divided over multiple
 * products that have different vat rates.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 * - Exactly 2 VAT rates must be used in other lines (*).
 * - lines2Complete may contain multiple lines that may be split: tag
 *   meta-strategy-split is set to true.
 *
 * Note:
 * - This strategy should be executed early as it is an almost sure win and is
 *   used as a partial solution for only some strategy lines.
 * - (*) In 1 case we had an order with 3 rates, 1 of them being 0 on a â‚¬0,01
 *   discount line. So, if the shop only sells VAT liable products, we actually
 *   look at the number of positive vat rates and ignore any 0 vat rate.
 *
 * Strategy:
 * Only lines that satisfy the following conditions are corrected:
 * - To prevent "correcting" errors that lead to this non-matching VAT rate,
 *   only lines that are marked with the value meta-strategy-split are
 *   corrected.
 * - Each line2complete must have at least 2 of the values 'vatamount',
 *   'unitprice', or 'unitpriceinc', meaning that it can be divided on its own!
 * - They have gone through the correction phase, but no matching VAT rate was
 *   found, so the value 'meta-vatrate-matches' is set to 'none'.
 * These lines are split in such a way over the 2 allowed vat rates, that the
 * values in the completed lines add up to the values in the line to be split.
 *
 * Current (known) usages:
 * - PrestaShop (discount lines)
 *
 * @noinspection PhpUnused
 *   Instantiated via a variable containing the name.

/**
 * Class ApplySameVatRate implements a vat completor strategy by applying the
 * same vat rate to each line to complete.
 *
 * It will try all vat rates in property $possibleVatRates, including a vat rate
 * of 0%. If that works, the system might be misconfigured OR we have prepaid
 * vouchers, but as we have to follow the system anyway, we will return it as
 * is.
 *
 * The order in which vat rates are tried is based on the number of times the
 * vat rate appears in the other lines, thereby preventing introducing
 * non-appearing vat rates on zero amount lines (where every vat rate tried will
 * succeed).
 *
 * Current known usages:
 * - Magento free shipping lines.
 *
 * @noinspection PhpUnused
 *   Instantiated via a variable containing the name.

/**
 * Translator provides a simple way of providing translated texts.
 *
 * Most web shops offer their own language handling, but to prevent repeating
 * all the translations in the web shop specific way, this library defines its
 * own way to get translated texts.
 *
 * How the translation system works:
 * - A single Translator object will be created by the {@see Container} and
 *   injected into every object that needs access to translated texts.
 * - The current language of the request should be passed and will be used as
 *   language to get the translations for.
 * - This single Translator object should be fed with translations by adding 1
 *   or more {@see TranslationCollection} objects.
 * - If multiple {@see TranslationCollection} objects are added, the latter will
 *   not overwrite already existing translations. This allows to define web shop
 *   specific vocabulary and add it directly upon instantiating the
 *   {@see Container}, thus before the request is handed off to the library.
 *
 * How to define translations:
 * - Create a class that extends {@see TranslationCollection}. Create a class
 *   per logically grouped set of features. You should typically create a
 *   collection per form/page, for mailing, invoice processing, etc.
 * - Add properties per language, named after the 2-character code for that
 *   language.
 * - This property should contain a keyed array of strings, the keys being the
 *   keys used in the calling code when a translated text is needed and the
 *   values being the translated text.
 * - If a text needs to be parameterised, use ordered arguments, like %1$s, as
 *   the order may differ between languages.
 * - Typically, this library is translated into Dutch and English, Dutch being
 *   the main language.

 *
 * How to use translations:
 * - If you need to translate texts in a given class, have the Translator Object
 *   injected into it via the constructor. If you are overriding a base class,
 *   most of the time, the base class will already have done so. If not, ask for
 *   a change in the library.
 * - Normally, when the Translator object is injected into a class, also a
 *   wrapper method t() is defined to get a translation.
 * - If a text is parameterised, use {@see sprintf()}, with the translated text
 *   as 1st argument.

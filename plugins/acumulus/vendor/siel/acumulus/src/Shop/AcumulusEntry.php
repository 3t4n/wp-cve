/**
 * An AcumulusEntry links a webshop order or credit note to an entry in
 * Acumulus.
 *
 * Acumulus identifies entries by their entry id (Dutch: boekstuknummer) or,
 * for a number of API calls, a token. Both the entry id and token are stored
 * together with information that identifies the shop invoice source (order or
 * credit note) and create and last updated timestamps.
 *
 * Concepts do not have a token, they only have a concept id. As this feature
 * was added after this class and the underlying storage had been created, we
 * store the concept id in the entry id field and use the token field (empty or
 * set) to determine what the entry id field refers to.
 *
 * A 3rd "type" of entry is a "lock" entry that is inserted just before an
 * invoiceAdd request is sent and deleted/replaced with a real record after the
 * result has been received. This is used to prevent sending an invoice twice at
 * more or less the same time.
 *
 * Summarising, each entry characterises one of the following:
 * - Entry: entryId = entry id AND token = token
 * - Concept old style: entryId = null AND token = null
 * - Concept new style: entryId = concept id AND token = null
 * - Lock record: entryId = const lockEntryId AND token = const lockToken
 *
 * Most web shops also require/expect a single primary key (technical key) but
 * that is irrelevant for this class.
 *
 * Usages of this information (* = not (yet) implemented):
 * - Prevent that an invoice for a given order or credit note is sent twice.
 * - Show additional information on order or order list screens.
 * - Update payment status.
 * - Show or resend(*) Acumulus invoice PDF.
 *
 * Note: some of these features are only implemented in the Acumulus
 *   WooCommerce plugin.

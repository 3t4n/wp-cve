 * Although we would like to use strict equality, i.e. including type equality,

 * - API responses return each value as string, even if it is an int or float.
 * - The shop environment may be lax in its typing by, e.g. using strings for
 *   each value coming from the database.
 * - Our own config object is type aware, but, e.g, uses string for a vat class
 *   regardless the type for vat class ids as used by the shop itself.
 * So for now, we will ignore the warnings about non strictly typed comparisons
 * in this code, and we won't use strict_types=1.

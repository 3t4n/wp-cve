## Why use Plausible?

Google Analytics is frustrating to use, difficult to understand, slow to load and privacy-invasive. That's why we built Plausible Analytics, a simple but powerful, lightweight, open source and privacy-friendly alternative. 

Here's what makes Plausible a great Google Analytics alternative and why over 12,000 paying subscribers trust us with their website and business insights:

### Smooth transition from Google Analytics

Plausible features a realtime dashboard, entry pages report and integration with Search Console. You can track your paid campaigns and conversions. You can invite team members. You can even [import your historical stats from Universal Analytics](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import). Learn how to get the most out of [your Plausible experience](https://plausible.io/docs/your-plausible-experience) and join thousands who have already migrated from Google Analytics.

### Simple analytics at a glance

Plausible is simple analytics. It is easy to understand and it cuts through the noise. Check your site traffic and get all the essential insights on one page in one minute. There are no layers of menus, there is no need for you to build custom reports, custom dashboards or PowerPoint documents.

### Lightweight script that keeps your site speed fast

Plausible is lightweight analytics. Our script is 45 times smaller than Google Analytics. Your page weight will be cut down, your site will load faster and you'll reduce your carbon footprint for a greener and more sustainable web. A site with 10,000 monthly visitors can save 4.5 kg of CO2 emissions per year by switching.

### No need for cookie banners or GDPR consent

Plausible is privacy-friendly analytics. All the site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously. Cookies are not used and no personal data is collected. There are no persistent identifiers. No cross-site or cross-device tracking either. Your site data is not used for any other purposes. All visitor data is exclusively processed with servers owned and operated by European companies and it never leaves the EU. 

### Track goal conversions, revenue and campaigns

Plausible is useful. Segment your audience by any metric you click on. Answer the important questions about your visitors, content and referral sources. Analyze paid campaigns using UTM parameters. Track WooCommerce revenue, outbound link clicks, file downloads and 404 error pages. Create custom events with custom dimensions to track conversions and attribution. Increase conversions using funnel analysis.

### Invite team members and share your dashboard

Plausible is shareable. Your stats are private by default but you can choose to be transparent and make them public so anyone with your custom link can view them. You can also share your stats privately by generating a secure link. This link is impossible to guess but you can add password protection for extra security. You can invite team members and assign user roles too.

### Transparent and open source software

Plausible is open source analytics. Our source code is available and accessible on GitHub so anyone can read it, inspect it and review it to verify that our actions match with our words. We welcome feedback and have a public roadmap. If you're happy to manage your own infrastructure, you can self-host Plausible too.

In the search field type "Plausible Analytics" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

For more information, visit the [Plausible Analytics website](https://plausible.io/). And for answers to all the frequently asked questions, [check out our documentation](https://plausible.io/docs).

= Why should I stop using Google Analytics on my website? =

We may be biased but we donâ€™t recommend you use Google Analytics on your WordPress site because of these reasons:

Itâ€™s owned by Google, the largest ad-tech company in the world
Itâ€™s a bloated script that affects your site speed
Itâ€™s overkill for the majority of site owners
Itâ€™s a liability considering GDPR, CCPA and other privacy regulations
It uses cookies so you must obtain consent to store cookies
Itâ€™s blocked by many plugins and browsers so the data is not very accurate
It requires an extensive privacy policy
Itâ€™s abused by referral spam that skews the data
Itâ€™s a proprietary product so you need to put your trust in Google
It worsens the user experience due to the necessity for the annoying prompts

= Why is Plausible not free like Google Analytics?  =

Google Analytics is free because Google has built their company and their wealth by collecting and analyzing huge amounts of personal information from web users and using these personal and behavioral insights to sell advertisements.

With Plausible, you 100% own and control all of your website data. This data is not being shared with or sold to any third-parties. Since we don't make money from targeted advertisement, we must charge a subscription fee.

Revenue from subscriptions is used to pay our rent, further develop Plausible and allow us to commit to Plausible and open source full time.

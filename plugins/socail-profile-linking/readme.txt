== Description ==

This is a simple social profile linking plugin that allows you to easily insert social icons in your site! with shortcode or php code embed or through widget easily for use in template. It comes with good CSS styling, the icons are all RETINA-READY!

After installing the plugin you'll have the new Social Profiles section found under Settings, where you can enter in the URLs of your social  profiles for the services you use. If you do not enter a URL, that social icon will not appear.

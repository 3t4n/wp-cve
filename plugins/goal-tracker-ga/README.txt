Goal Tracker - Custom Events Tracking for Google Analytics 4

== Description ==

**TLDR:** Goal Tracker for Google Analytics GA4 is a no-code plugin that helps you set up event tracking for your WordPress website. 

This plugin makes it easy to track in-page elements such as call-to-action buttons, forms, ad visibility, and more with Google Analytics GA4. Best of all is that you don‚Äôt have to write custom code. 

Working with GA4 can be challenging, especially if you migrate from Universal Analytics. But if you give it a chance, GA4 can become a powerful tool. 

We set out to help you become an advanced user of Google Analytics without having to learn code. 

## üéÅ¬†What‚Äôs in the box?

1. **Track Links** - both internal and external
2. **Track Email Links** - We create a dedicated event for email links. 
3. **Visibility Tracking** - Fire an event when an element comes into view on the page (Ads, CTA buttons, Pricing Tables‚Ä¶)
4. **Click Tracking** - Track user clicks on any element on the page, such as a contact form submit button or a call to action button. 
5. **Recommended Events** - Our user interface takes out the guesswork when using ‚Äúrecommended events‚Äù. 
6. Much more to come in the next few months. 


> **Upgrade to our Pro version:**
> Goal Tracker for Google Analytics GA4 is the professional version of our plugin and adds more tracking capabilities:
>
> * WooCommerce Tracking
> * User Tracking
> * Placeholders to enrich your event data

## üè∑¬†Already using Google Tag Manager?

While Google Tag Manager has been here for years, we think that could improve when it comes to event tracking. 

Goal Tracker for Google Analytics reduces the guesswork involved with recommended events and only takes a few clicks. 

Oh, and the plugin can work on a website that already uses Google Tag Manager.

== Description ==

Preload Featured Images automatically in posts to increase the PageSpeed Score.

This plugin is a "must-have" for websites using themes that display the Featured Image automatically at the top in single post pages.

== Why was this plugin created? ==

Suppose your theme displays the Featured Image at the top in posts automatically. In that case, the chances that the image is the **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** are very high, so the PageSpeed tool will highly recommend you to preload it.

== How it works? ==

Go to the **Settings > Preload Featured Images** page and choose the image size used by your theme to make sure the right image size is preloaded.

== Compatible Themes ==

The plugin supports all themes, but it's very important to choose the right Image Size on the settings page.

If you are not sure which is the image size used by your theme, simply get in touch with your theme's developer and they will be able to help you with that.

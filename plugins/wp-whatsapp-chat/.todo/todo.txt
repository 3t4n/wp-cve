Hi, this list is great but I will sugest to include WAme.chat
This is a free plugin with some goodies we think are worth considering:
– Polylang support.
– You can create a call to action
– Automated Google Analytics integration
– Facebook events integration
– Random Phone. You can add a list of phones to your support and distribute incoming mesages
– Add specific phones per page, section, etc.
– And some more.

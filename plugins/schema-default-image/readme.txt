== Description ==

Like Schema Default Image extension? Consider leaving a [5 star review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/schema-default-image/reviews/).

Schema Default Image is an extension for the Schema plugin, it extend Schema functionality by adding ability to set a default image, which will be used in schema.org markup output if no Featured image is attached to the post.

Google requires every [Article](https://schema.press/docs-premium/add-schema-article/) and [BlogPost](https://schema.press/docs-premium/add-schema-org-markup-blogposting/) to have an image property within its schema.org markup, otherwise you will get an error in Rich Results testing tool and Search Console.

Removes the WordPress credit on all default WordPress themes and replaces with a widget sidebar for those wanting to customise the theme.

== Description ==
= Remove "Proudly powered by WordPress" =

This plugin removes the "Proudly powered by WordPress" for those who want to use the default theme for their website but don't want everyone to know what they've used to build it. Content can then be added in its place with a new "Site Info" widget area on some themes.

For block themes, you do not need to use this plugin, just edit the footer template in the Site Editor. We do have a plugin, [Options for Block Themes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/template-editor/ "Options for Block Themes"), that adds additional features and options to block themes.

This plugin works on all classic default WordPress themes (and child themes) including ...

- Twenty Twenty One (widget area not implemented as it's not suitable)
- Twenty Twenty (widget area not implemented as it's not suitable)
- Twenty Nineteen (widget area not implemented as it's not suitable)
- Twenty Seventeen
- Twenty Sixteen
- Twenty Fifteen
- Twenty Fourteen
- Twenty Thirteen
- Twenty Twelve
- Twenty Eleven
- Twenty Ten

... and now includes the following additional themes (and child themes) ...

- Customizr (widget area not implemented when "Classical" theme style set)
- Envo Shopper
- GreenLeaf
- Masonic
- MinimalistBlogger (widget area not implemented)
- Neve (widget area not implemented)
- NewsCard (widget area not implemented)
- Newsup (widget area not implemented)
- OnePress
- Seedlet theme (widget area not implemented)
- Solid Construction
- Inspiro theme
- Snaps (widget area not implemented)
- Tonal
- Travelbee

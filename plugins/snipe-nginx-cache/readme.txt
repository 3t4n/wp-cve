Purge the Nginx FastCGI cache manually, or automatically when content is updated. Supports purging of individual pages.

== Description ==

Nginx has a built-in FastCGI cache, which acts as a reverse proxy cache at the webserver layer. The Cache Sniper for Nginx WordPress plugin lets you purge this cache from within WordPress. Here are some key features:

* Purge the entire cache from the menu bar
* Manually purge individual pages
* Manually purge homepage cache
* Configure pages to purge automatically when updated
* Configure pages to purge automatically when comments are created/updated/deleted.
* Configure Settings via WP CLI

For more info on using this plugin with a pre-configured Nginx stack running in AWS, follow this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0771QTMR5).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/snipe-nginx-cache` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in WordPress
1. Go to **Tools** -> **Nginx Cache Sniper** to configure the plugin

**Usage**

1. Clear the entire cache by going to the **Nginx Cache Sniper** drop-down in the top **Menu bar**, and click **Clear entire cache**.
1. Clear the homepage cache by going to the **Nginx Cache Sniper** drop-down in the top **Menu bar**, and click **Clear homepage cache**.
1. To clear the cache for an individual Post (or Page), click on **Clear cache for this page**, either on the **All Posts** or Post detail pages.

1. When configured to do so, you can purge the cache for a Post (or Page) where a comment was created/updated/deleted.

**Configuration Settings**

Cache Sniper for Nginx comes with the following settings:

1. **Cache Path**: This is the filesystem path where the FastCGI cache is stored on-disk. Set this to the value you used for `fastcgi_cache_path` from your Nginx configuration. **Note**: Nginx needs read/write access to this location.
1. **Cache Levels**: This sets up a directory hierarchy under the cache path. Set this to the value you used for `levels` from your Nginx configuration. For example: `fastcgi_cache_path /var/lib/nginx/cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=CACHE:100m;`
1. **Automatically clear page cache on content update**: Check this box to automatically purge the cache when a page is updated. This only purges the updated page -- it does not clear the entire cache.
1. **Automatically clear page cache on comment**: Check this box to automatically purge the cache when a comment is created/updated/deleted. This only purges the cache of the page where the comment resides -- it does not clear the entire cache.
1. **Automatically clear homepage cache on content update**: Check this box to automatically purge the homepage cache when a page is updated. This only purges the homepage -- it does not clear the entire cache or the cache of the page where the content resides.
1. **Automatically clear homepage cache on comment**: Check this box to automatically purge the the homepage cache when a comment is created/updated/deleted. This only purges the cache of the homepage -- it does not clear the entire cache or the cache of the page where the content resides.

**Configuration via WP CLI**

For those scripting out infrastructure, Cache Sniper for Nginx can be configured via WP CLI:

1. `wp plugin activate cache-sniper-nginx`
1. `wp option add nginx_cache_sniper_path '/var/lib/nginx/cache'`
1. `wp option add nginx_cache_sniper_levels '1:2'`
1. `wp option add nginx_cache_sniper_auto_clear 1`

For instructions on setting up FastCGI caching with Nginx, refer to this [Digital Ocean blog post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-fastcgi-caching-with-nginx-on-your-vps).

**Server-side configuration**

There are a few things that need to be configured on the server in order for this plugin to work.

1. Be sure to set `$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri` for `fastcgi_cache_key`. For example: `fastcgi_cache_key  "$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri";`
1. The Linux account running Nginx needs read-write permissions to the cache path on disk.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to recompile Nginx to purge the cache? =

No. Cache Sniper for Nginx works without relying on any custom Nginx modules. This means you can easily keep Nginx updated with your normal package manager.

== Description ==

= Vimeo WordPress Plugin =

Looking for a powerful and easy-to-use solution to embed Vimeo videos on your WordPress site? Look no further than Vimeotheque – the ultimate plugin for managing Vimeo videos on WordPress.

With Vimeotheque, you can easily import videos from Vimeo into your WordPress site as custom post types. The plugin supports the latest Vimeo HTML5 video player, making it easy to embed responsive videos that look great on any device.

Whether you want to embed a single video or a playlist of videos, Vimeotheque has you covered. The plugin is optimized to display multiple videos on the same page, and allows only one video to play at a time to prevent conflicts.

Vimeotheque is also fully compatible with the WordPress Block Editor and comes with three blocks that allow you to quickly insert and edit your videos. You can even use the plugin's widget to display your latest videos in your site's sidebar.

With the Pro version of Vimeotheque, you get even more features, including automatic bulk import, support for private videos, and compatibility with video themes. Plus, you'll receive priority support to ensure that any issues are resolved quickly and efficiently.

= Vimeotheque Video Importers =

Vimeotheque provides multiple options to import Vimeo videos into WordPress. You can use a Vimeo video URL, search for videos, or import entire channels, categories, showcases, groups, portfolios, or user uploads and then select the videos you want to add.

However, it's important to note that before you can start importing videos, you must create a Vimeo App and enter the credentials into the Vimeotheque Settings page.

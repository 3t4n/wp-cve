== Description ==

It works with Contact Form 7, Divi, Ninja Forms and Gravity Forms. Define advanced rules for the dates and times available or disable the ones that are not needed.

= Works well with Contact Form 7 and Divi =

Perfect for **appointments** or **booking forms** that need to follow certain **opening times** and **booking rules**, the Date and Time Picker plugin integrates well with **Contact Form 7** or **Divi** plugins through the CSS selector. Follow the rules for [Contact Form 7](https://www.inputwp.com/about/date-and-time-picker-field-on-contact-form-7/) or [Divi](https://www.inputwp.com/about/date-picker-in-divi-contact-form/).

= Upgrade for more =

- **Date range** (type)
- **Automatic integration** (no code required) with Contact Form 7, Gravity and Ninja Forms.
- Fresh **new theme** for the date picker (dropdown)
- Ability to **fully customize the theme** with the right **Colours** for typography and backgrounds, with the right **Font** and **Labels**.

- **Time Step** — Define time intervals in a minute for the time picker. If you set 60, then the time picker will show time choices as 12:00 AM, 01:00 AM, and so on.
- **Minimum Time** — It allows you to define time in a slot from where a user can start choosing time.
- **Maximum Time** — It allows you to define the time that would be regarded as the last time in a slot a user can choose from the time picker.
- **Offset for available times** — Using this option, you can offset time from Now to the next available time. If right now it’s 03:15 PM, and you choose to offset 45 minutes, then the next available time would be 04:00 PM.

- **When to Load** — Choose when and where to load the date time picker fields. Whether across the full website, for admin panel, full website including the admin panel, or only when the date time picker shortcode is available on a page.
- **Disable Week Days** — Don’t want to receive bookings or reservation forms on certain days of the week? Worry not, using this option you can easily disable the days by merely checking the box next to the week name.
- **Disable Specific Dates** — Taking a vacation or don’t want to receive forms on certain dates? Simply input dates in the Disable Specific Dates field of the Advanced settings to hide dates from the calendar.
- **Default list of allowed times** — It enables you to provide users with a list of allowed times to choose from in the time picker for different days.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I have more than one date time picker field on my site? =

Yes, you can have multiple fields, however, with the free version, every field would have the same rules. If you choose to get the PRO version, then you can have different rules for different pickers.

= Is it necessary to have a contact form plugin(CF7 / Divi) on my site? =

Our plugin workday only through integration with other plugins like Contact Form 7, Divi, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms.

= How do I prevent the DateTime Picker scripts and styles from loading across all my website? =

In the settings page for the plugin you can find the option to load the necessary files only when the shortcode [datetimepicker] exists on the page.
If you have this option selected, the plugin will only look for fields to convert when this shortcode exists on that page.

= I’ve installed the plugin, but not able to get it to work? =

If you’re wondering how to start using this plugin, you should check out our [documentation](https://www.inputwp.com/features/). Still facing issues? Reach out to us on our [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/date-time-picker-field).
If you have purchased the premium version, then get support from [here](https://www.inputwp.com/support/).


= How do I add specific times for different days? For example, for weekends? =

In the settings page for the plugin you can find a 'Advanced Settings' tab were you'll find some options to set available times for each day. You'll need to individually set each time available as default, for example '09:00,09:30,09:50,10:50,11:30' and then override this default values for each day you need. It will not work well if you don't setup a default list of allowed times. The list of times still needs to be inside the minimum and maximum times set in the 'Basic Settings' tab.

= Does it work with any theme? =

Yes, it works fine with any of your favourite themes.

= Should I keep the Basic plugin and the PRO plugin active? =

When you install the PRO plugin, it will automatically import your input created from the Base plugin without the need to have the Based plugin activated so it can be uninstalled.

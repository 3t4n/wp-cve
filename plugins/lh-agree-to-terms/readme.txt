Add a HTML5 "Agree to terms" check box on login or registration forms.

== Description ==
I wrote this plugin as I needed full flexibility when adding an "agree to terms" check box to your login or registration forms,

Not only does this plugin facilitate requiring users to agree, but also allows you to customise and configure the terms and conditions message, add links, and also the customise the message those who have not agreed see.

Additional features include:

* User registration support
* Buddypress support
* Multisite support

== Installation ==


1. Upload the entire `lh-agree-to-terms` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to Settings->Agree to Terms to enable for login and/or registrations, once enabled you can set details like label and error message.

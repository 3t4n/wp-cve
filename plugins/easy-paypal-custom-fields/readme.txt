Easily add a PayPal 'donate' or 'buy now' button to your site.

== Description ==

This plugin makes adding a PayPal button to your site or blog very easy. There is no complicated shortcut syntax to remember (or to teach a client).

You can select on which type of post (including custom post types) you'd like to display the button.

There is a settings page for default values (username, currency etc), which can be customized for individual posts. (This might come in for sites with multiple users).

Choose from four custom button themes (with custom button text): light, dark, blue and red. If you prefer, you can simply display a standard large or small PayPal button.

Your PayPal username is converted to HTML entities so it can't (easily) be harvested for spam by species 8472, or any passing Sith lord. It's not a foolproof method, but it helps.

This plugin is created for WordPress 3.x and supports 'Buy Now' and 'Donation' functionality.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the Easy PayPal Custom Fields folder to the plugins directory in your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin (don't be scared!)
3. Enter you default settings and select on which page or post type you'd like the button to appear
4. Add a new post (or edit an exisiting one) - you'll find another options box underneath the textarea where you write your blog entries
5. Enjoy


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What types of button can I use? =

Currently you can only use 'buy now' or 'donate' buttons. I've tried to keep it as simple as possible.

= I've added my settings, where is the rest of the stuff so I can add a button to my page already? =

In the edit posts screen (when you're writing a new post or editing an existing post), look under the textarea (where you write your blog) to find another settings box for the plugin.

= This is the Real Deal that you need =

The Live Copy Paste is a feature developed to work with Elementor Page Builder. Here, users get to access a secret control over the UI that allows them to import/export live pages, sections, widgets, and any kind of designs (including all modifications) in one click.

This is where it gets interesting.

Live Copy Paste does not only work for live pages but also works for static or dynamic websites. That includes demo pages, section blocks, ready templates, and lots more. Using this addon, you can copy the layout from both the front end and backend.
This gives the users maximum flexibility and is convenient to use anywhere anytime.

Live Copy Paste is a cross-domain feature that only we are selling for free.


== Features ==

= Cross Domain Copy Paste- =

Live Copy Paste empowers you to import web design from one website built with Elementor to another website instantly. Best for web designers to boost their work output.

= Page Duplicator- =

Duplicate pages, posts, and templates from your WordPress dashboard with a simple click. The duplicator feature is further enhanced to make copies of designs, product pages, testimonials, and everything that you need on WordPress.


= Best Use For =

The Live Copy Paste option is designed for our global users who want to work around WordPress to easily design web fronts.
In most cases, the UI designers need to transfer the creative designs from the staging site to the main domain. Using the basic methods (compiling zip files), the layout often breaks as well as bugs happen.

Thatâ€™s not all, if you need to import any design quickly, you canâ€™t do that here.

But with Live Copy Paste installed on your WordPress site, the problem goes away. Thereâ€™s no need to wait for a template import/export. You can directly click over any page, section, or widget to copy that and paste it to the target site instantly.

- WordPress installation (free)

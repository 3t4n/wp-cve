Magazine Blocks is a powerful Gutenberg page builder plugin that is focused entirely on creating websites for magazines, news portals, and blogs.

Craft visually stunning and highly detailed websites with a variety of post layouts, including grids, banners, post lists, and tabbed posts. You can also display posts as per categories using blocks like Category List and Featured Categories.

Additionally, several blocks designed specifically for magazines and news are also accessible, including Date & Weather, News Ticker, Social Icons, Advertisement, and so on. With the help of the Section block, you can organize all these blocks in rows and columns.

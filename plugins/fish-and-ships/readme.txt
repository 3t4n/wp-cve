You can set multiple conditional rules on the table rate: based on price, weight, product quantity on cart, dimensions, volume, shipping class, product tag, and product category.

While there are other table rate-based shipping rate calculation plugins, only Fish and Ships allows you to add multiple criteria selections to every rule:

*(condition #1 AND condition #2 AND condition #3)*, or (condition #1 OR condition #2 OR condition #3)... as you needed, on every rule!

...from the simplest to the most complex selection criteria, any need can be fulfilled!

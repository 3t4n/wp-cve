WPC Shoppable Images is impressively a versatile, multipurpose, and powerful plugin, which helps you increase your sales by creating shoppable images.

== Description ==

Open a new world in which images are turned into highly converting tools for your online store with **WPC Shoppable Images for WooCommerce**. Users can place different hotspots on images to show text or link products visually to take the shopping experience to a higher level.

To get a first-hand experience of our plugin, feel free to check out on your own on the [live demo](https://demo.wpclever.net/wpcsi/ "live demo").

The powerful hotspots act as visually engaging product tags that indicate the items demonstrated in an image. Each hotspot can have a distinguished set of configurations to best fit the sellers’ intention. Thus, this plugin makes it easier for shop owners to redirect traffic from pages and feeds to their online store. Moreover, using short-code, users can embed a shoppable wall to any place they’d prefer to attract more attention and improve brand identity.

Shoppable images are highly adjustable: multiple products can be added and shown as a list or carousel, product images, prices, texts, and content popup are editable. The text of the content supports short-code so users can display a countdown timer (using WPC Countdown Timer) or show cart content (using WPC Fly Cart - check out live demo for more information). It’s you who decides which style will be best for your site: showing content on hovering or tapping or initial loading of pages. For sites that use AJAX, combining with WPC AJAX Add to Cart will help you make a complete circle for buyers without worrying about the bounce rate or cart abandonment.

Results-Oriented Google Analytics and visitor intelligence for WordPress.

== Description ==

Intelligence's goal is to provide truly actionable insight that enable teams to make better, data-driven decisions and create more impactful web experiences. 

Intelligence adds results oriented events, custom dimensions and metrics, and reporting to Google Analytics directly from WordPress. It is designed to enable smarter, empirical web development, UX, content strategy and marketing. Intelligence streamlines creation and management of a results oriented analytics measurement plan focused on goals and valued events. WordPress integrated reports provide insight into the value a website and its various components are generating enabling teams to better inspect and adapt to optimize returns.

Intelligence also adds individual visitor insight to drive deeper engagement and accelerate sales cycles.

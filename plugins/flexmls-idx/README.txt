Integrated with Flexmls Portals, Contact Management, and Saved Searches, you can seamlessly switch between everyday MLS tasks and following-up with your incoming website leads.

### INCLUDES 5 WIDGETS ###
Our powerful and flexible widgets lead your website visitors to and through the home search information they most want to see:

1. **IDX Search Widget** - customize how your visitors search and filter results. Perfect for your home page or as a sidebar for any content.
1. **Listing Summary Widget** - provide a gallery-style, photos-first impression for search results that are easy to browse and navigate.
1. **Listing Detail Widget** - large images in a modern slideshow lead the way beside a quick-look layout that highlights the most important information to buyers.
1. **IDX Slideshow Widget** - slides seamlessly into any webpage. Control sizing and animations for a wide variety of uses.
1. **Market Statistics Widget** - visually demonstrates market trends to help educate buyers and sellers and establish you as the area expert.

### UNLIMITED CUSTOM SEARCHES ###

Turn any Custom Search in Flexmls into an IDX-enabled search that can be applied to select widgets, making it easy to create listing displays for niche markets or neighborhoods.


### LEAD CAPTURE CONNECTED TO THE FLEXMLS PLATFORM ### 

Flexmls Portal registration prompts (controlled by you) are baked into the Plugin and entice visitors to sign-up for your branded Portal account, allowing them to save their own searches, favorite listings, and create email subscriptions. Move prospects easily from lead status to active buyers in the Portal once they’re ready.


### LIVE DATA ###

NO EMBARRASSING TIME DELAYS. The Flexmls IDX Plugin is connected directly to the Flexmls Platform via our industry-leading API, meaning listing data on your website will be as up-to-the-second fresh as the data you view in Flexmls yourself!

### BROKER VERSION AVAILABLE ###

The Plugin is available for growing real estate brokers as well as individual agents, with additional features specifically to assist brokers with showcasing their agents and their listings, as well as assigning incoming leads.


### WORLD-CLASS SUPPORT ###

Support is provided directly from the FBS HQ in North Dakota by both email and phone. We also offer a comprehensive <a href="https://fbsidx.com/help" target="_blank">Help Center</a> available 24/7, regular webinars, and other tools for success via our <a href="https://fbsproducts.com/success-academy/" target="_blank">Success Academy at www.fbsproducts.com</a>. 

### 30-DAY RISK-FREE EVALUATION PERIOD ###

We don’t offer 7-day trials with dummy data because we don’t believe that’s an effective way for you to test-drive the product. We know that websites come together in a matter of weeks not days, which is why we give you a whole 30 days to evaluate our product, risk-free, with your own live and local MLS data.


== Installation ==

The Flexmls® IDX WordPress Plugin is available ONLY to agents and brokers with access to Flexmls and requires an annual subscription to activate listing data within the plugin.

1. Once your subscription is activated, we will ensure all your MLS approvals are handled and you will receive an email with an Activation Key and Secret code which connects the Plugin to Flexmls data and your own Flexmls Portal.

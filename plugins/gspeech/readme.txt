GSpeech is a __universal audio solution__. It has different player types, to read out loud your articles and any content. It supports three player types, with 16+ themes.
Also it has a special player called __RHT Player__, which allows to listen to the audio of any selection from your website. See RHT section bellow.

Please check the [__screenshots section__](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gspeech/#screenshots) to see RHT player in action.

= Is it FREE? =
Yes! There is no audio limit fory the GSpeech 2.X(__included in the same package__), and for the GSpeech 3.X the limit is __50k__ characters __each month__!
Characters are being counted on a new content only. Then audio file is stored on the cloud, and can be played __unlimited__ times.

= GSpeech Structure! =
Gspeech has a __Flexible Architecture__!

Each account can have up to __ten websites__! Each of them has its settings and analytics!

__Website Settings__:

You specify the __Website Language__, and Default Voice. (Speed and Pitch of voices can be configured, for AI voices).

The players generation is made by the __Smart Widgets Architecture__:

__Widget Settings__:

There are six types of widgets: __Full Page Player__, __Button Player__, __Circle Player__, __RHT Player__, __Welcome Messages__, __Custom Audio__.

Main section of each widget is:

**Content Settings**
__1: Content Selector:__ specifies which elements should be __included in the audio__. HTML markup being used, which means you call elements by its __html values__. 
__Usage__:
To call element by __class__, __.(dot)__ is being used. For __id__, __#__ being used.
You can specify more than one element there. Separate with __,(coma)__.
__NOSPEECH Class__:
To exclude some part of content from the audio, add the class __nospeech__ to the containing element of that piece of content.
__Greather-then >__:
Can be used, to navigate to parents element. Example: __.mydiv>.parentdiv__ .
__Less-then <__:
Can be used, to navigate to children element. Example: __.mydiv<.childdiv__ .

There are two keywords: __self_class__, and __parent_class__, relative to _Render Element_.
If you write __self_class__, ir will use the same content, as __Render Element__ has, and for __parent_class__ it will use the parent elements content.

__2: Render Element:__ specifies where to render the widget. 
__Usage__:
To call element by __class__, __.(dot)__ is being used. For __id__, __#__ being used.
__Data usage__: Structrue: __data__-{attribute_name}_:_{attribute_val} .
If your element has __data-id="777"__, you can access it: __data-id:777__ .

__3. Exclude List__: specifies which elements should be excluded from audio(HTML markup being used, which means you call elements by its html values. To call element by class, .(dot) is being used. For id, # being used). You can specify more than one element there. Separate with ,(coma).

__4. Title Text__:  Player Title. Will be used as top text for the __Full Page Player__, content for __Button Player__, and title for __Circle Player__.

__5. Title Selector__:  Use this to catch the post title, and show it in the player. __Example__: _h1_. Leave it empty, if you are using Title Text.

__6. Allowed Urls__: The list of  urls, where the player should be rendered. Use __*(asterisk)__ to match any character. 
__Example:__ use __www.example.com/blog*__ to render on all blog pages.

__7. Blocked Urls__: The list of  urls, where the player should not be rendered. Use __*(asterisk)__ to match any character.

You can [contact-us](https://gspeech.io/contact-us), and we will configure it for your website.

= How to use with Elementor! =
To use with __Elementor pages__, add the shortcode __[gspeech type=button]__(type can have values of: __full/button/circle__) anywhere in the content.
By default it will include the content of __parent element__, where the player placed.

To change the element, which content will be included in the audio, set the _custom class_ to your _elementor_ wrapper in the __advanced__ tab. For example set the class __my_gsp_player__(in elementor you put value without dot).
Then go to __WP Admin->GSpeech->Cloud Console->Widgets->Shortcode Widget__(depends on the type you use, choose full/circle/button), go to __content__ tab, and set __content_selector__ to the value you specified in the _Elementor custom class_.
In our example it will be __.my_gsp_player__(here dot is required).

That's all.

You can [contact-us](https://gspeech.io/contact-us), and we will quickly configure it for your website.

= Cache plugins compatibility - WP Fastest Cache and others =
Some of the cache plugins make caching of the required js files, and GSpeech stops working.
Usually any cache plugin has the exclude list. To fix that, go to:
__Exclude->Exclude JS__ and add the word __gspeech__.
That will solve the issue.

= Do I need to pay for Google TTS and Translate API keys usage? =
No, __all the TTS keys__ and the automatic real time translations are included in all packages(commercial plans).

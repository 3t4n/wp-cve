Next Watermark helps you easily add automatically watermarks text or/and image type on your images (GIF, JPEG, PNG and WEBP formats supported)! Backup/restore at any time.

== Description ==
Next Watermark is the simplest way to add automatically watermarks text or/and image type on your .gif, .jpg, .png and .webp photos when uploading them in the Wordpress media library.
You can choose the text, size, font, transparency, position and orientation of your watermark text.
You can also use directly any watermak image in GIF, JPEG or PNG formats, choosing special effects, opacity, orientation and absolute, relative or preset positions.
Watermarks can be applied on GIF, JPEG, PNG or WEBP images.
You can choose the image types, the images sizes and the post types to apply your watermarks or not.
You can use backup to save your images before watermarking, and restore them automatically with a simple button.
English & French language available. It is very light too.

This plugin comes with the following fonts, but you can add your own fonts.
Arial, Arial Black, Comic Sans MS, Courier New, Impact, Tahoma, Times New Roman, Verdana

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why won't this work? =
It does work. If not just let me know! ;-)
Do not forget to apply your filter!

= Can I have both text and image watermarks on my images? =
Yes, you can choose to apply text or/and image watermarks automatically when uploading new images in the Wordpress media gallery.

= When I upload a new image to use as a watermark, is it automatically watermarked? =
No, this has been corrected since 1.2, so a new watermark is now not watermaked of course!

= How can I set a watermark on bottom right corner of all my images with different sizes? =
It is very easy, you can set offset X and Y with negative value to be relative to right and bottom sides.
For example set X and Y to -10px value to always have your watermark on bottom right corner of all your images even with different sizes.
To set an image watermark, you can even use the preset positions to choose where to apply your watermark on your photos.

= How can I add other fonts? =
Just upload the .ttf files you need in the /fonts directory of the plugin to be able to use them.

= If I uninstall the plugin, are watermarks removed from my images?
No you must choose to restore your images BEFORE to remove the plugin.
You can also restore your images manually from the wp-content/NWM directory.

= Is it possible to restore my photos after watermarking? =
Yes, if you have selected the backup option, you can restore all your images as before watermarking by pressing the 'Restore' button.
You can choose to restore ALL the images from backup directory, or ONLY the images which are in your media library (the images you could have removed before from your media library won't be restored with this option).
You can also go to the wp-content/NWM directory and manually select the images you want to restore, copy them to the /uploads directory of your Wordpress installation to replace the ones which has been watermarked.
Only fullsize images are backed up, but it's very easy with any other plugins to generate the missing thumbnails again.

= Is it possible to restore only some images? =
Yes, just go to the wp-content/NWM directory and manually select the image you want to restore, copy it to your /uploads directory of the Wordpress installation to replace the one which has been watermarked.

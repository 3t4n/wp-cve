Our White Label WordPress plugin lets you make a custom admin experience. Create a custom login page, a custom dashboard, and much more.

== Description ==

Our White Label WordPress plugin lets you make a custom admin experience for your clients. Create a custom login page, build custom dashboard elements, modify admin menus, and much more. 

Building a custom admin experience is ideal for web developers and agencies who work with non-technical clients. You can use White Label to create a custom login page and a custom dashboard that matches your client's brand and identity.

Make WordPress easier and less confusing for clients by cutting unnecessary parts and features.

## Custom Login Page
Make your client's experience better when you use White Label to rebrand the WordPress login page. Our plugin lets web developers and agencies make a custom login page for their clients to use every time they use WordPress.

Create your site's custom login page look by adjusting its layout, color scheme, background image, and even adding a custom logo. Your custom login can match every element of your client's brand and identity. Clients really appreciate it when you take the time to make a custom login page that matches their branding.

In addition to login page branding, White Label lets you remove a handful of interface elements. Remove the Remember Me checkbox, the WordPress Language Switcher, the Go to Site link, and the Lost Your Password link. You are in total control of the login page interface when you use White Label.

## Custom Dashboard
After you've built a custom login, it is time to move on to the dashboard experience. Tidy up the first things your users see when they use WordPress by making a custom dashboard. This is the easiest way to make life easier and less confusing for non-technical users. Your clients don't need to read or access most of the default information available on the WordPress dashboard. You can use White Label to make your own custom dashboard experience by removing widgets or creating your own.

Create a custom welcome panel to replace the default one provided by WordPress. Remove dashboard widgets or create your own custom dashboard widget with whatever content you want clients to see. Want to replace the entire WordPress dashboard? You can with White Label. Create your very own custom dashboard with White Label for all your users to see when they log in.

## Custom Admin
White Label isn't only ideal for creating a custom login page or custom dashboard. Our plugin lets you change other parts of the WordPress admin as well.

Use our White Label plugin to configure parts of the WordPress admin so your clients only see what you want them to see. The custom admin features of White Label let you hide entire sections of the menu. Control exactly which menu options other users can see when they are logged in. Use White Label to also hide individual plugins so that your clients can't accidentally delete or update plugins without your knowledge. You can do the same for themes.

In addition to those features, White Label offers more custom admin options. Set an admin color scheme and apply it to all users when they log in. Make text changes to the WordPress admin's menu bar and footer. You can even add custom JavaScript right into the WordPress admin; perfect for integrating live chat widgets and other ways to communicate with clients.

Building a custom admin experience that is tuned to your users and their exact needs helps cut down on confusion and support requests.

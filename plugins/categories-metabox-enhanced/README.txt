Replace the checkboxes with radio buttons or a select drop-down in the built-in Categories metabox and Gutenberg sidebar panel.

== Description ==

Thanks to [Taxonomy_Single_Term](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Taxonomy_Single_Term), a library created by [WebDevStudios](http://webdevstudios.com/), it made my work much easier on creating this plugin.

With Categories Metabox Enhanced, you can:

* Change the built-in Categories metabox/panel to a single term UI, which means replacing the checkboxes with radio buttons or a select drop-down.
* Apply the single term UI to other hierarchical taxonomies in the plugin's Settings page.
* Customized the single term UI by setting these options:
 * Priority and position of the metabox placement.
 * Title of the metabox.
 * If child-terms should be indenting.
 * If adding of new terms from the metabox is enable.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `category-metabox-enhanced` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

The Proof Factor plugin requires a Proof Factor account to function. You can create one at https://app.prooffactor.com/register

***How To Install:***

*Install and Activate the Plugin*

1. Install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. At this point, if you do not already have a Proof Factor account one will be created for you with your Wordpress admin email as the username!
4. Once the plugin is active you should receive a welcome email as well as a password reset email. Make sure to follow the instructions in the password reset email to access your Proof Factor dashboard.

*Configure the plugin*

1. Navigate to the Plugins -> Installed Plugins page
2. Scroll down until you find Proof Factor and then click Settings
3. If the Account Id and User Id are already filled in that is because a new account has been created for you using the Wordpress admin email as explained above.
4. If the Account Id and User Id are blank this is because we could not automatically create a new account for you, or you already have an account. You will need to update these details with the information found at the bottom of https://app.prooffactor.com/settings
5. Once you have entered your Proof Factor Account Credentials click Update Proof Factor Credentials

Notes:

* The Proof Factor plugin calls Proof Factor backend servers in order to create a new user account for you using your Wordpress admin email address.

* The Proof Factor plugin will load remote JavaScript/CSS/HTML code from the  Proof Factor backend URL in order to show notifications of recent purchases on your frontend store and to always deliver the latest version of the Proof Factor plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this remove notices? =

No, it simply hides them from the admin interface with CSS styling. Simple, yet quite effective.

= Does it hide all notices? =

Not yet. We're adding in notices where plugin or theme developers are not using standard notice classes in CSS. Did we miss something? Please let me know in the support!

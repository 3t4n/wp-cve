Create your WordPress site easier and faster directly in the Gutenberg Block Editor without coding using core blocks and block themes.

== Description ==

Content Blocks Builder (CBB) is a tool that helps you create **custom blocks**, **variations**, **styles**, and **patterns** directly in the **Block Editor** without using a **code editor**.

WordPress, with its Gutenberg Block Editor, provides a robust foundation for building websites. However, when you need something **more specific** or **unique** features that are not available in the default blocks, you have to build custom solutions or explore third-party options. CBB is designed to help you create those **unique layouts and features** easily, eliminating the need to seek out third-party plugins.

The core feature of CBB is to create custom blocks by grouping core blocks or third-party blocks into a container block. This container block offers native features such as typography, colors, spacing, border, etc., along with a bunch of custom advanced features that help you create common layouts such as **grid**, **carousel**, **accordion**, **modal**, **off-canvas**, etc. You can also create **repeater blocks** to display repeating content that works similarly to the ACF repeater field. For more information, please check out [the detailed guide about CBB blocks](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/documentation/custom-blocks/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB+Blocks).

The goal of CBB is to help you build a **complex website** with WordPress using only core blocks and native Gutenberg features with any block theme.

=== Key Features ===

 - **Manage custom blocks**: Create, edit, copy, import, and delete custom blocks.
 - **Create repeater blocks** like ACF repeater fields that support grid, carousel, accordion, and vertical stack layout
 - **Advanced block support features**: Modal, off-canvas, toggle content, sticky, etc.
 - **Manage block variations & block styles**: Create, edit, copy, import, and delete block variations. It works on any block.
 - **Manage block patterns**: Create, edit, copy, import, and delete custom block patterns.
 - **Enhance the Query Loop block**: Add grid, carousel layouts, and advanced filter and sorting settings.
 - There is a library of pre-built blocks, variations, styles, and patterns
 - Load Google Fonts easily with a few clicks
 - **Import/export** custom blocks, variations, and patterns from/to other sites

=== Why choose CBB? ===

 - CBB **adheres to Gutenberg**, making it **user-friendly** and **easy to use**. If you are familiar with the Block Editor then you are already familiar with CBB.
 - CBB **uses core blocks** to build container blocks, ensuring itâ€™s **fast**, **clean**, **flexible**, **bloat-free** and **code-free**.
 - Sites built with CBB are **easier to maintain** as most tasks are accomplished through the Block Editor. You don't need to know React to create a complex block or maintain a code repository for it.

=== Which theme should I use with this plugin? ===
It is compatible with all Gutenberg-ready themes, but our recommended themes are default themes such as [Twenty Twenty Four](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfour/), [Twenty Twenty Three](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/), [Twenty Twenty Two](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/), or [Astra](https://wordpress.org/themes/astra/) theme.

=== How does it work with other blocks/plugins? ===
This plugin works with all third-party blocks but we recommend using single-block plugins for lightweight and performance. We also develop several single block plugins, that work great with this plugin, please see them in the below section.

=== Design library ===

We have already included a library of block patterns for you to quickly use or customize to fit your design. There is a popup inserter in the block editor for you to find and insert patterns with a few clicks.

[How to use the pattern inserter popup](https://youtu.be/UTrZSBvkzj0).

Browse the **[Design Library](https://boldpatterns.net?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)** to see what the plugin can do for you.

=== Block and Variation library ===

Besides the pattern library, we have built an external library of content blocks and common block variations. All of the blocks/variations in this library have been created by CBB directly in the Block Editor. With a few clicks, you can easily import blocks or variations into your site. You use them directly or customize or learn from them.

Watch some video tutorials to learn how to use the library:

[Import the particles background block](https://youtu.be/BVvImhhZma4).

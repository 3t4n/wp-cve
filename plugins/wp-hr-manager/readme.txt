This plugin uses [WP ERP] BY Tareq Hasan,Nizam Uddin,weDevs.

== Description ==

Now you can easily manage HR (Human Resource) records and processes from within your website with our highly rated plugin, WP-HR Manager. You can quickly install an ESS (employee self-service) portal and HRM system, update staff records, track attendance and absence, message team members, approve leave and more.  

Ideal for small and medium sized businesses (SME) who want to create their own HR information system (HRIS) on WordPress.  

= WP-HR Manager enables you to: = 
* Install a powerful HRM system on your website to record and manage employee HR information via any browser 
* Take advantage of employee self service (ESS) features to reduce admin and improve accuracy (ideal for remote workers)
* Retain control of your data (and host your site/data in the location of your choice) helping with GDPR compliance
* Manage as many employees as you wish, with our free HR WordPress plugin: No incremental/per employee charges unlike cloud based HR systems
* Add features and plugins as you need them (even build your own!) with fully editable open source code
* Control access to data and capabilities with three inbuilt user levels (Admin, HR Manager and Employee)
* Keep it focussed - WP-HR Manager only adds HR features, keeping the plugin as lite as possible

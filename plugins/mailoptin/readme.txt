### Features of MailOptin Premium

= Automated Newsletters =

MailOptin integrates WordPress with all major email marketing providers to send automated newsletters and event-triggered emails. This can be very useful if your email marketing service lacks such.

For example, **Sendy** is a newsletter application without integration with WordPress to send *new publish post notifications* to an email list. MailOptin bridges this gap and delivers your post content immediately after publication.

Use MailOptin today to deliver new post notifications and email digest newsletters to subscribers of email lists in Mailchimp, Constant Contact, Campaign Monitor, Klaviyo, ActiveCampaign, ConvertKit, Infusionsoft, Brevo (Sendinblue), SendGrid, Mailjet, CleverReach, Zoho Campaigns, MailerLite, Sendy, SendGrid, iContact, E-goi, Mailgun, [WordPress users](https://mailoptin.io/send-emails-wordpress-registered-users/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), [MemberPress members](https://mailoptin.io/article/send-wordpress-emails-memberpress-members/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), [LifterLMS students](https://mailoptin.io/article/send-wordpress-emails-lifterlms-students/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), [LearnDash users](https://mailoptin.io/article/send-wordpress-emails-learndash-users/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), [Tutor LMS users](https://mailoptin.io/article/send-wordpress-emails-tutorlms-users/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), [Paid Memberships Pro members](https://mailoptin.io/article/send-wordpress-emails-paid-memberships-pro-members/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), [Easy Digital Downloads](https://mailoptin.io/article/send-emails-edd-customers-wordpress/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), [Restrict Content Pro Members](https://mailoptin.io/article/send-wordpress-emails-restrict-content-pro-members/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) & [WooCommerce customers](https://mailoptin.io/article/send-emails-woocommerce-customers-wordpress/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), [Active subscribers in WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://mailoptin.io/article/send-emails-woocommerce-subscriptions/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), [Members in WooCommerce Memberships](https://mailoptin.io/article/send-emails-woocommerce-memberships/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), [GiveWP donors](https://mailoptin.io/article/send-emails-givewp-donors-wordpress/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) etc.

= A/B Testing: Take out the guesswork =

Marketers are constantly using trial and error to guess what will be most effective — but they shouldn't have to. A/B content testing lets you see what optin campaign will be most effective before sharing it with your larger audience—no more guesswork.

MailOptin ships with an easy built-in A/B testing feature that enables you to make data-driven decisions to improve your conversions and revenue for any optin campaign. [Learn more](https://mailoptin.io/ab-testing-wordpress/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion)

= More highly converting optin types =

There are cases where you would find popups, sidebar, and in-post optin forms an inappropriate solution. That is why we offer different optin form types such as [notification bars](https://mailoptin.io/notification-bar/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) and [slide-ins popups](https://mailoptin.io/slide-in/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), so you don't have to rely on one way of collecting leads and install multiple software and platforms to achieve them.

= Powerful Content Locker =

Block a portion of your content for subscribers only. [Content locking](https://mailoptin.io/article/setup-wordpress-content-locking/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) requires users to enter their email addresses to see the full article; otherwise, they will see a blurred content.

= Conversion Boosting Optin Display Rules & Triggers =

MailOptin includes several [WooCommerce display rules & triggers](https://mailoptin.io/woocommerce-targeting/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) to display targeted call-to-actions across your WooCommerce shop. Want to display a popup when a product is added to the cart? We've got you covered. The following conditions are available for creating upsells, down-sells & cross-sells: Products in Cart, Customer, has Purchased, Cart Item Count, Cart Total, and Customer Spent.

Timing is everything. This is why MailOptin continually tracks visitors' interaction on your website and displays the right message or optin form when they are likely to convert.

Our [exit-intent popup technology](https://mailoptin.io/demos/exit-intent/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) and [slide-ins](https://mailoptin.io/slide-in/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) trigger convert abandoning visitors into subscribers by your optin campaign at the precise moment they are about leaving your website.

If your opt-in form displays too early, your reader might not yet be willing to subscribe, and waiting too long will make you lose out on new leads. Our [Pageviews](https://mailoptin.io/demos/pageviews/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) and [Time on Site](https://mailoptin.io/demos/time-on-site/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) triggers give you fine-grained control over the display of your optin campaigns.

The [Scroll Trigger](https://mailoptin.io/demos/scroll-trigger/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) displays optin forms or messages only after a visitor scrolls a down a specific percentage of your page.

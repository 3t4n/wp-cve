== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add single or multiple backgrounds that spans behind whole website contents. You can

1. Set single background
2. Configure multiple backgrounds to behave as slideshow
3. Randomize Backgrounds for each refresh
4. Set animation duration and delay
5. Add dotted Overlay 
6. Set Opacity of Background Images
7. Set single or multiple images for individual pages 
8. Select where backgrounds should be displayed

If image is larger than the user's resolution, plugin will stretch either width or height (keeping aspect ratio) to fit on the screen. It will also centralize the image. If image is smaller than the user's browser resolution, It will be displayed centered in the background without stretching.

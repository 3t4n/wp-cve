Premium members should head to our [Support Center]((https://5starplugins.com/get-support/)) or use the “contact us” form to request tech support from the plugin settings page.

= Will it automatically start popping up? =
Once you activate the plugin verification is disabled by default. Verification will not begin showing until settings are configured.

= Where do I go to edit plugin options? =
After successful installation and activation of this plugin, go to “Easy Age Verify” in your WordPress Dashboard located in the left sidebar.

= How do I setup my plugin to begin working? =
Visit the plugin settings page to enable verification and select a turnkey configuration. During setup we recommend using Testing Mode to preview age verification hidden from visitors. When it’s ready to be seen by the public, select “show verification”. Set “disable verification” to stop it from showing completely.

= Can I edit default text? =
The age prompt and disclaimer text are editable in the standard plugin. Upgrade to the Premium plugin to edit all default text including the buttons and error message. The Premium plugin is translation ready.

= Are multiple languages supported or translation? =
The Premium plugin is translation ready. Easy Age Verify was developed in the U.S. with default text written in English.

= Does it block visitors from seeing the site? =
Yes, the standard default setting hides content 100% with an opaque blackout background. Upgrade to Easy Age Verify Premium to set the background color and adjust transparency 0-100%.

= Can I edit the design and add a logo? =
The display is independent of Theme CSS to ensure a consistent and clean user experience. It will use your theme’s font family to match website fonts. Add your logo, welcome message and colors with Easy Age Verify Premium.

= How does preview work? =
Testing Mode allows admins to preview verification without visitors seeing it. After configuring plugin settings, visit your site to view the verification screen. Built-in cache clearing will help refresh the display when settings are saved. [Step-by-step Preview Guide](https://support.5starplugins.com/article/80-preview-the-display)

= Why isn’t my age verify window displaying? =
There are several reasons why you might not see the age window popup although it is working correctly.
**Enabled?** Verification is disabled by default until you select “enable verification” in plugin settings.
**Excluded?** If using the “except to logged in users” setting, it will not show while you are logged in.
**Verified?** If you’ve recently completed verification yourself, it will not show again due to the session cookie. Clear your browser cookie.
[Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.5starplugins.com/article/79-my-age-verify-window-is-not-popping-up)

= How does the cookie work? =
The plugin uses a standard cookie for the duration of the user’s session. This prevents the popup from showing on every page after the visitor has verified. Once they close the browser window and exit your website the session ends. Age verification will display again when they return. Improve the user experience by offering a return visitor cookie to remember customers, available with Premium upgrade. If you've clicked "yes" while testing age verification, you can use the clear cookie button from the settings page.

= What age does this validate? =
An adult content warning specifies 18+. Vape verifies if visitors are of legal smoking age in their location. Alcohol specifies 21+ and can be edited. The  disclaimer section can be used to address various laws and locations. Easy Age Verify Premium can be customized to verify any age for anything in any language.

= Will it show ads on my website or collect data? =
Our plugin is 100% ad free and we do not collect or store visitor data.

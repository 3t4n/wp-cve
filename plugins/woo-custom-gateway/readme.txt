Add multiple custom payment gateways to WooCommerce e-commerce plugin.

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to create an infinite number of custom payment gateways for WooCommerce. After a payment gateway is created, you can edit its instructions and email sent to the customer directly in the WooCommerce payment settings menu.

Features:

♦ Create unlimited custom payment gateways
♦ Edit payment gateway instructions and customer emails in WooCommerce settings
♦ Easy customization of gateway options for customers
♦ Add multiple URLs to ping after an order is created
♦ Simple creation process for new payment gateways

Note: You will need to manually update the order status as the order progresses from On Hold/Processing, as this gateway has no way of tracking the order.

This plugin also includes non-intrusive ads (shown only in the backend) that help support the ongoing development and maintenance of the plugin. Please see our privacy policy for information on data collection.

QuadMenu is a WordPress Mega Menu that will allows you easily integrate the menu in your theme's project. This plugin allows you to create mega menus, tabs menus and carrousel menus in a simple and native way converting your existing menu into a powerful tool. 

== Highlights==

* Simple & Automatic integration from simple menu to megamenu.
* Intuitive menu, easy to set megamenu options.
* Fully responsive menu.
* Customizable mega menu, gives the possibility to add or remove fields, and modify option with simple drag & drop.


== Description ==

== Mobile ==

This WordPress Mega Menu is a responsive menu, which means that the layout will fit all screen sizes. Nevertheless, the difference with other alternatives is that the touch screen events have been incorporated natively, substantially improving the user experience in touch screens.

== Layouts ==

[Collpase](https://quadmenu.com/layouts/collapse/) | [Offcanvas](https://quadmenu.com/layouts/offcanvas/) | [Vertical](https://quadmenu.com/layouts/vertical/) | [Sidebar](https://quadmenu.com/documentation/)

We also must mention the variety of available layouts that highlights this wordpress mega menu over other alternatives. This is the first mega menu that’s all in one solution, as you’ll be able to create an horizontal or vertical menu in desktop devices and collapsible or offcanvas menu in mobile.

== Drag & drop ==

The drag and drop admin panel is another key feature that stand out this megamenu. From the native menu administration panel you can manage all the content of your megamenu trough a drag and drop interface that allows you to add new elements, create columns and add widgets or any other type of element available in the native WordPress menu metaboxes.

== Customize ==

Finally, we must stand out the integration with the customizer dashboard. This is a feature that’s only available in the premium megamenu version and is an important feature if you will include this plugin in your themes project, as this allows you and your end users to tweak all menu color scheme or layout settings and see the effect of that changes in real time.

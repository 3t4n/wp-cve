Disables the default WordPress option of converting emoticons to image smilies

== Description ==

As of the release of 4.3, WordPress removed the "Formatting" section from the Writing settings.  Included in there was the option to turn off WordPress's default action to convert text emoticons to image smilies.  This plugin does the same thing as unchecking the "convert to smilies" box that used to be available via the settings.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `keep-emoticons-as-text` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Change the (more...) link so that it jumps to the entire post, not just just the part after the (more...).

== Description ==

Change the (more...) link so that it jumps to the entire post, not just just the part after the (more...). For example, suppose you go to the Nursery Blog and look at the front page. You might see a summary of the latest post that looks like the following.

> **Nursery Blog**
> 
> Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall  
> Humpty Dumpty had a great fall

Click the more link and you see only the remainder of the post:

> All the king's horses and all the king's men  
> Couldn't put Humpty together again

But with Seemore, you'll see the full article:

> **Nursery Blog**
> 
> Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall  
> Humpty Dumpty had a great fall  
> All the king's horses and all the king's men  
> Couldn't put Humpty together again

This is more intuitive. (Your intuition may vary.) After I click a (more...) link, I often find myself scrolling up to make sure that I am where I think I am, and I'm not missing anything.

== Installation ==

Just install and activate Seemore, and it starts working straight away.

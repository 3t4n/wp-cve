    <h2>How to replace a single image per page with a new one of your choosing </h2>
    <p>To replace an image on a post or page you need to go to the edit option of the post or the page. Below you can see a screenshot of the upload logo or image section found at the bottom of your page editor. If you want to replace an image or logo for a single page you have to put your image link on the original image source field and select an image from media library for the one you want to show instead.

Sometimes you may need to use images that are <strong>sensitive</strong> and not suitable for everyone. A popular technique is to <strong>Blur</strong> or hide the image until the <strong>user clicks on it</strong>. With Image tools pro you can do that from the <strong>Media library</strong> or using a <strong>CSS class</strong>. This technique can also be used to increase clicks and interactions with your website which is good for SEO.

Alt tags are important for SEO. This feature will take all <strong>empty</strong> alt tags and create an ALT tag The alt text will be chosen from page or post title elements if the image is attached to a page or post. Otherwise, <strong>file name</strong> will be used as the alt-text attribute of unattached images in media library. This is best used when you have properly named files or if you have loaded images into the media library in bulk. This feature searches for all images within the library which are missing alt-text attributes. Hyphens and other symbols will be converted to <strong>spaces</strong>. Any image that already has text in the ALT field <em>will not be touched</em>.

You can also <strong>Bulk Edit</strong> the ALT tags of all your Images from a <strong>convenient single user interface</strong>.

= No Right Click on Images =
The No Right Click on Images feature uses JavaScript to change the right click action <strong>only on IMG tags</strong> to disable the context menu. It disables the context menu on images only so other right click actions, such as links, should work normally. Great tool to deter casual theft.

This feature adds a button to the<strong> Attachment Details</strong> screen that allows you to upload or select an image to <strong>replace</strong> the current <strong>image</strong>. The image URL and attachment ID is left <strong>unchanged</strong>. This lets you to easily <strong>swap</strong> in an updated version of an image without having to re-select it in theme settings pages, post/page content, or anywhere else where it might be referenced.


= Image Refresh =
Vary the images on your site to keep things fresh for your returning visitors. The <strong>Image Refresh</strong> feature allows you to randomly display a different image from a set of image you define on every page load.

The Smart Custom Display Name Plugin allows you to set your Display Name to anything you like

== Retired Plugin ==

Development, maintenance and support of this plugin has been retired in october 2023. You can use this plugin as long as is works for you. 

There will be no more updates and I won't answer any support questions. Thanks for your understanding.

Feel free to fork this plugin.

== Usage ==

The "Display Name" is the name shown as post author - e.g. "posted by John Doe". WordPress only allows you to select from a few given values. This plugin changes the Display Name field to a regular text input field where you can type in anything you like. There are no settings. Just install and activate.

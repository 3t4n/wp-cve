Adds support to Popup Maker for Newsletter subscription forms

== Description ==

This simple and little plugin integrates the [Popup Maker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/popup-maker/) plugin with forms 
of [Newsletter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/newsletter/) plugin, usually generated via
shortcodes. It follows the Popup Maker standard integration methods.

Note: this plugin should be considered as developed indipendently from Newsletter and Popup Maker. For support, contribution and so on
use the support area provided by wordpress.org. Much appreciated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to configure =

Please see the screenshots for steps explained below.

Step 1. Just create a popup and in the page content add the shortcode [newsletter_form]. This shortcode just shows a subscription form 
(you can customized it using the many attributes available â€“ like labels, button color and so on). 
[Read more about shortcode attributes](https://www.thenewsletterplugin.com/documentation/subscription/subscription-form-shortcodes/).
 
Step 2. Setup the popup rules to not reopen after a subscription has been submitted.

= Which Newsletter shortcodes can I use? =

As far as I know, every kind of shortcodes work. All details about shortcodes and subscription forms creation
should be found [here](https://www.thenewsletterplugin.com/documentation/subscription/subscription-form-shortcodes/).

= Does the popup open for "old" subscribers? =

Actually yes, there is no way to block the popup if an "old" subscriber is revisiting the site. Maybe I can find a solution
(I'm open for ideas and/or code to integrate!)

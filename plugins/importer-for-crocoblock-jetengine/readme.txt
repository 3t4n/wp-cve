== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What version of WP All Import do I need to use this? =

The JetEngine Importer is made to support both free and Pro versions of WP All Import.

= Why aren't all the fields included for free? =

The additional fields require much greater development and maintenance resources to manage. In order to provide the best experience possible and ensure the ongoing development of this add-on it was necessary to offer a paid Pro Pack. Even with the nominal fee for the Pro Pack, it's a small fraction of what it would cost to have a developer create a one-time custom solution.

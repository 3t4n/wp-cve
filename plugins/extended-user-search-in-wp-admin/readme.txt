== Description ==

By default WordPress in WP-admin allows users to search only by username or email id.

But what if you want to search user by first name or last name or both. What if you want to search by entering only partial email address/id or username or by bio, you cannot do it as by default. WordPress do not come with this feature.
This plugin eliminate above limitation. Which could perform search based on full-name, first-name, last-name, email, username and bio.
"Extended User Search In WP-admin" Plugin that allows admin to search user much more deeply and overcomes the limit possessed by WordPress.

Note :- This plugin is inspired from "Improved user search in backend" and "User First Name / Full Name Search In WP-admin" plugins.

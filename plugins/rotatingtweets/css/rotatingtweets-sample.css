/* 
The easiest way to have special CSS for Rotating Tweets is to use additional CSS - as per https://codex.wordpress.org/CSS#Custom_CSS_in_WordPress
 
If you want to use the approach that Rotating Tweets used before additional CSS was available, rename this file to rotatingtweets.css and upload it to /wp-content/uploads/rotatingtweets.css and it will automatically be included in the rotatingtweets CSS by the plug in - and won't be overwritten when the plug-in is upgraded!

This particular CSS makes a bird appear to the left of your tweets - you can find more birds at https://about.twitter.com/en_gb/company/brand-resources.html

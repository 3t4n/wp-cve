== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I uploaded my picture, but the cursor has not changed. =

Make sure your image is in JPG, PNG, GIF format. Try resetting the page cache Ctrl + F5 (Win) or Cmd + R (MAC OS).

= I uploaded an image in GIF format with animation, but my cursor is not animated =

Unfortunately gif animation will not work. You will see a non-animated GIF cursor

= How do I return to the standard cursor =

You can delete the image by selecting the checkbox below the image on the "Cursor settings" page or simply deactivate the plugin. In case of deactivation of the plugin, the image will not be deleted and you can always return to this image.

= I reset the page cache but the image of my cursor did not appear. =

Make sure your browser supports javascript, and if so, it is most likely that your style design of the site is using special style settings, in which case you will have to change the cursor through the stylesheet of your site (not through this plugin).

= I got the message "Sorry, but this image could not be processed." =

The plugin uses WordPress functionality for image processing. Unfortunately, for some reason, the function failed to process the image. Try loading a different image.

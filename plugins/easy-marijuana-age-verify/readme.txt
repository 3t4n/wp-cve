== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get support? =
Visit the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/easy-marijuana-age-verify/) for questions about the free standard plugin. If you’ve upgraded, please do not post questions about Premium to the forum. Premium members should head to our [Support Center](https://5starplugins.com/get-support/) or use the “contact us” form to request tech support from the plugin settings page.

= Will it automatically start popping up? =
Once you activate the plugin verification is disabled by default. The plugin will not begin showing until settings are configured.

= Where do I go to edit plugin options? =
After successful installation and activation of this plugin, go to “Marijuana Age Verify” in your WordPress Dashboard located in the left sidebar.

= How do I setup my plugin to begin working? =
Visit the plugin settings page to enable verification and select a turnkey configuration. During setup we recommend using Testing Mode to preview age verification hidden from visitors. When it’s ready to be seen by the public, select “show verification”. Set “disable verification” to stop it from showing completely.

= Can I edit the default text? =
Default text is not editable in the standard plugin except for an empty disclaimer text field. Upgrade to the Premium plugin for a free-form option to edit all text fields. The Premium plugin is translation ready.

= Are multiple languages supported for translation? =
The Premium plugin is translation ready. Upgrade to Premium to use the “Free-form” option to customize all text that displays to visitors. Marijuana Age Verify was developed in the U.S. with default text written in English. Language support is coming soon to our plugin settings page on the backend.

= Can I edit the design and add a logo? =
The display is independent of Theme CSS to ensure a consistent and clean user experience. It will use your theme’s font family to match website fonts. Visitors will see a hint of your web page behind an elegant black opaque background. Edit background color and transparency, and add a logo and welcome message with Marijuana Age Verify Premium.

= How does preview work? =
Testing Mode allows admins to preview verification without visitors seeing it. After configuring plugin settings, visit your site to view the verification screen. Built-in cache clearing will help refresh the display when settings are saved. [Step-by-step Preview Guide](https://support.5starplugins.com/article/53-preview-display)

= Why isn’t my age verify window displaying? =
There are several reasons you might not see the popup although it is working correctly.
**Enabled?** Verification is disabled by default until you select “enable verification” in plugin settings.
**Excluded?** If using the “except to logged in users” setting, the popup will not show while you are logged in.
**Verified?** If you’ve recently completed verification yourself, it will not show again due to the session cookie. Clear your browser cookie
[Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.5starplugins.com/article/142-my-age-verify-window-is-not-popping-up)

= How does the cookie work? =
The plugin uses a standard cookie for the duration of the user’s session. This prevents the popup from showing on every page after the visitor has verified. Once they close the browser window and exit your website the session ends. Age verification will display again when they return. Improve the user experience by offering a return visitor cookie to remember customers, available with Premium upgrade. If you've clicked "yes" while testing age verification, you can use the clear cookie button from the settings page.

= What age does this validate? =
The standard plugin offers turnkey configurations to validate medical or recreational cannabis ages ranging 18+, 19+ and 21+. Marijuana Age Verify Premium provides a free-form option to fully customize age verification to any age. It also includes a bonus turnkey option to verify 18+ medical and 21+ recreational together for dual dispensaries.

= Will it show ads on my website or collect data? =
Our plugin is 100% ad free and we do not collect or store visitor data.

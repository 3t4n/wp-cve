= How to map Product Fields? =

Drag & Drop the field from a feed File Data Preview on the right side to the fields on the left. The Product mapper is similar to the interface of the WooCommerce Product Edit Screen. You may also add multiple fields from an XML/ CSV file & add your own text or values.

Please go to the Dropshipping XML tab &rarr; Import Manager &rarr; Choose the file &rarr; Click Edit mapper. Check the field and data in the name and description. Drag & Drop the field from the right side (File Data Preview) again making sure the path is pointing to the value you want. Also, see if there is no additional or missing character.

= Is it possible to create a category tree automatically? =

Yes. The plugin lets you import WooCommerce products with categories and subcategories as a category tree!

= Titles and categories changed after the import overwriting my changes. Why did it happen? =

During the import, the Dropshipping XML for WooCommerce plugin creates or updates selected product fields. If you want to import or update only selected (not all) product fields, set this in the last part of the settings for the file (Import options). If you have already set that, go to the Dropshipping XML tab &rarr; Import Manager &rarr; Choose the file &rarr; click Edit options. Choose the product fields you want to update in the Synchronize product fields option. You may read more about Import options in the [plugin documentation](https://www.wpdesk.net/docs/dropshipping-xml-woocommerce/#Step_4_Import_options).

= I started the update and noticed new products were added, but they had already been imported. Why were new ones created? =

Sometimes it may happen when you change the name or SKU of your products before the next import. In such a case, the plugin does not find an existing product to update but creates a new one as there is no product with such a name or SKU.

Check the products' identifier - which is the name or SKU in the Import options. Go to the Dropshipping XML tab &rarr; Import Manager &rarr; Choose the file &rarr; click Edit options &rarr; check the Import into products on the basis of the setting. Read more about Import options in the [plugin documentation](https://www.wpdesk.net/docs/dropshipping-xml-woocommerce/#Step_4_Import_options).

For variable products, this setting is visible in the Product mapper. Go to the Dropshipping XML tab &rarr; Import Manager &rarr; Choose the file &rarr; click Edit mapper &rarr; Product Data metabox &rarr; Variants &rarr; check the option. You may read more about Import options in the [plugin documentation](https://www.wpdesk.net/docs/dropshipping-xml-woocommerce/#Step_4_Import_options). Read more about settings for variants in the [plugin documentation](https://www.wpdesk.net/docs/dropshipping-xml-woocommerce/#Variable_Products).

= My products disappeared from my store after the update. What could've happened? =

These products' stock could've been updated to 0. Also, if you have chosen Change shop products stock to 0 in the No product in XML/CSV file option (in the Import option screen).

First, go to WooCommerce &rarr; Settings &rarr; Products &rarr; Inventory &rarr; see if the Out of stock visibility option is checked. It may be the indirect reason for missing products when their stock reaches 0.

Check also Import options by going to the Dropshipping XML tab &rarr; Import Manager &rarr; Choose the file &rarr; click Edit options &rarr; check the Change shop products stock to 0 option. You may more about all Import options in the [plugin documentation](https://www.wpdesk.net/docs/dropshipping-xml-woocommerce/#Step_4_Import_options).

This plugin is a Up2pay e-Transactions payment gateway for WooCommerce 4.x

== Description ==

This module adds a Up2pay e-Transactions Payment Gateway to your Installation of WooCommerce.

Up2pay e-Transactions is a Payment Services Provider in Europe, part of the CrÃ©dit Agricole Bank.

plugin actions in wordpress:

this plugin offers an admin panel from the order section to the settings of Woocommerce.
it adds payment information to the orders details and changes the status of orders (upon reception of an IPN, see below.) and adds payment means on the checkout page.

This plugin takes information from the order and creates a form containing the details of the payment to be made, including parameters configured in the admin panel of the module that identify the mechant.

The plugin checks for availability of the Up2pay e-Transactions platform, through a call to our servers.
It then submits with javascript the form to the first available server.

the customer is then presented with a payment page, hosted on the Up2pay e-Transactions Platform (urls above).

The Up2pay e-Transactions Platform sends an Instant Payment Notification (IPN) to the server when the customer actually made the payment, indicating to the merchant the status of the payment.

the plugin generates a url that can catch the IPN call from Up2pay e-Transactions's server, filtering incoming calls to the Up2pay e-Transactions IP address.

if payment is successfull, then the plugin validates the order though woocommerce.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire folder `e-transactions-wc` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
or through WordPress's plugin upload/install mecanism.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the HMAC key in the admin panel for ? =

The HMAC key is generated on Up2pay e-Transactions server through your Up2pay e-Transactions back office. it is used to authenticate your calls to Up2pay e-Transactions Server. it is generated on the platform you choose: Production (live) or Pre-Production (test)

= My orders are not validated, even though the payment went through ? =

The oder paid with Up2pay e-Transactions is only validated upon rectpion of a positive Instant Payment Notification (IPN) this IPN is authenticated with the filter on the IP address, if the IP is somewhow changed, the plugin will give a 500 HTTP error.

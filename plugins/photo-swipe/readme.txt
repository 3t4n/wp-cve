This plugins adds the PhotoSwipe library to your WordPress blog seamlessly. No configuration required.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= It doesn't work with some of my photos, why? =
The PhotoSwipe library requires some special markup to be applied on images. This markup is applied with this plugin as soon as the post is saved. So if it doesn't work on images in some old post try to save that post again. It should work.

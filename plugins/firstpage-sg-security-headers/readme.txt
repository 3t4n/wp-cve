Security headers are directives used by web applications to configure security defenses.

== Why security headers important? ==

When auditing websites, security headers are frequently forgotten.

Although some may argue that website security is unrelated to SEO, it does become so when a site is compromised and search traffic completely disappears.

Everyone who publishes content online should pay special attention to security headers.

Getting hacked is not good. You lose traffic, customers and it’s a pain to resolve all the issues. 

But good thing you’re smart and have searched for this plugin :).

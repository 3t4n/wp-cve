# Installation

The recommended method of installing phpSmug is using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org). If you have Composer installed, you can install phpSmug and all its dependencies from within your project directory:

    $ composer require lildude/phpsmug


Alternatively, you can add the following to your project's `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "lildude/phpsmug": "^4.0"
    }
}
```

.. and then run `composer update` from within your project directory.

If you don't have Composer installed, you can download it using:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Adds a secure and simple widget in which you can use PHP and JavaScript code. Also you can use unfiltered HTML or just Text. Admin Use Only.

== Description ==

The usual Text widget allows you to insert arbitrary Text and/or HTML code. This allows that too, but also parses any PHP or JavaScript code in the text widget and executes it. 

This plugin is based on "PHP Code Widget", but now available for use by site administrators ONLY, which makes it more secure.

All PHP code must be enclosed in the standard php opening and closing tags ( `<?php` and `?>` ) for it to be recognized and executed. Also JavaScript code must be enclosed in the `<script>` and `</script>` tags, as usual.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `safe-php-code-widget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

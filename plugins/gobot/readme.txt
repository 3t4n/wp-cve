## Advanced Page Level Targeting and Behavior Personalization

Gobot allows you to create a highly targeted message based on the specific page or traffic referral source your visitor followed to arrive at your site. This allows you to segment your email list and group your subscribers based on their interest and interaction with your website.

Segmentation allows you to send relevant emails to your subscribers to achieve higher open rates, higher click through rates, increased sales and revenue, greater customer retention, and a lower unsubscribe rate.

Gobot can also be triggered when your visitors scroll to a particular spot on your website or at the precise moment your visitors are about to leave. This allows you to re-engage visitors and encourage subscription.

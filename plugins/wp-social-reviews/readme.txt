>__Great all-in-one plugin for social stuff, without the usual clutter__
>I’ve tested other social plugins, most of the time they were bloated with unwanted stuff. WP Social Ninja is feature rich, but very well-thought-out and seems pretty lightweight. It just works, templates are great and easy to set up and with a bit of CSS, you can do almost anything.
Using this allowed me to remove at least 3 others plugins that weren’t doing the job properly to begin with.
They also offer quick and thorough support on their product (using the Pro version at least).

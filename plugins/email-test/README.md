# Email Test

A simple WordPress plugin to easily test if your site is sending emails correctly.

Feel free to browse the code and make suggestions/requests. Thanks!

## Getting Started

We do not currently use any build scripts. This repo can be downloaded as a zip and installed as-is as a WordPress plugin.

Once installed, there will be a new **Email Test** page added to the Tools menu.

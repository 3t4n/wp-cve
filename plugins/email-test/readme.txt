Test your site's email to make sure emails are being sent and delivered.

== Description ==

Need to test to see if your site is sending emails correctly? Use this plugin!

Once activated, a new **Email Test** page will appear in the "Tools" menu of your admin menu.

On that page, you can enter in your email address to send a test email to it. If the email does not get sent, the plugin will attempt to catch the error from WordPress to provide to you.

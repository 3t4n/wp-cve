"<p>Passwords Evolved uses the \"Have I been pwned?\" API to determine if "
"someone is using a compromised password or not. You can read more about the "
"API <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2\">here</a>. You can find the "
"status of the API below.</p>\n"
"<p>You can also find all the roles used on your WordPress site. For each "
"role, you can toggle password enforcement on login. If password enforcement "
"is enabled for a role, someone with a compromised password won't be able to "
"log in until they reset their password with an uncompromised one.</p>"

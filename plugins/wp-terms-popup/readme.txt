Use WP Terms Popup to ask visitors to agree to your terms and conditions or privacy policy before they are allowed to view your site.

== Description ==

Control access to your WordPress site with a popup. WP Terms Popup gives you the ability to use a popup to restrict users from accessing your website. You can use the plugin to ask visitors to agree to your terms and conditions, terms of service, or privacy policy before they are allowed to view your site. Add an age verification check to your popups before they can be accepted.

## How Does WP Terms Popup Work?

WP Terms Popup gives your users a simple three-step process for gaining access to your website. Use this as a way to make sure your visitors are presented with your terms and conditions, terms of service, or even a privacy policy before viewing your WordPress site.

**Step #1: Your user must read the popup first.**

You decide what your popup shows to visitors: terms of service, a privacy policy, etc. You can include any content, such as text or images, that you would include in a typical WordPress post.

**Step #2: The user agrees to your conditions.**

Each popup contains two buttons: one to show acceptance and another that redirects away from your site. The popup will not go away until your user clicks the accept button to agree to the content of your popup.

You can add an optional age verification check to your popup as well that disables the accept button until a valid date of birth is entered. Age verification settings can be defined while you create your popup.

**Step #3: Website access is granted to your user.**

When the user accepts your popup they are immediately taken to your site without any further interaction. They will not see the popup again until your agreement expiration has expired.

## Getting Started

After installing and activating WP Terms Popup, go to "WP Terms Popup" in your WordPress admin menu and select "Add New" to create your first popup.

Go to "Settings" in the same "WP Terms Popup" menu to create the global settings that will apply to all popups. You can override some of these settings by editing each individual popup. 

From the "Settings" screen you can assign a popup to be shown sitewide or you can assign popups to individual pieces of content using the standard post editing screen.

You can set up age verification using the WP Terms Popup Settings meta box. Define how old a visitor has to be to agree to your popup. You can also set the order of the age verification dropdowns so the date format matches your country's format. The age verification feature is available in WP Terms Popup 2.6.0 and above.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I adjust the look and feel of the popups? =

If you are familiar with CSS, you can make changes to the popup's appearance. We recommend adding your CSS changes to a child theme or using the WordPress Customizer. For anyone not comfortable, or unfamiliar, with the safest way to make changes like this we have an add-on called [WP Terms Popup Designer](https://termsplugin.com/designer?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=plugin-repository&utm_content=faq) that can help.

= Does WP Terms Popup store any details about my users? =

WP Terms Popup uses a cookie to monitor when a user has agreed to a popup. The only information in the cookie is an identifier to track which of your popups they have agreed to. For more detailed information, we have an add-on called [WP Terms Popup Collector](https://termsplugin.com/collector?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=plugin-repository&utm_content=faq) that stores extra data about visitors who agree to your popups.

= How do I use a single popup for my entire WordPress site? =

After you've created your popup:

1. Go to the "Settings" page and select the checkbox for "Enable only one popup sitewide?"

2. Select your "Sitewide Terms Popup" from the dropdown.

3. Set an "Agreement Expiration" time if the default isn't right for you.

4. Press the "Save Settings" button.

= Can I have popups on different pages and posts? =

1. Create as many popups as you want.

2. Go to the edit screen of the post or page you want to show a popup on.

3. On the right-hand side of the edit screen, you will see the "WP Terms Popup" option box. Configure according to your needs.

4. Save the post or page.

= Can you add age verification to a popup? =

Yes. This feature is now available in the base plugin as of version 2.6.0. You can set up age verification using the WP Terms Popup Settings meta box.

= How do I disable a sitewide popup from appearing on a page or post? =

1. Go to the edit screen of the post or page you want to disable the sitewide popup on.

= Will my visitors be able to see the popup if they have Javascript disabled on their browser? =

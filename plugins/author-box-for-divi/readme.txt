A plugin which provides an author box for the Divi theme blog posts.

== Description ==

A plugin which provides an author box for the Divi theme blog posts.

Using this plugin, a simple author box that will show the WordPress author bio will be displayed automatically at the bottom of all your Divi blog posts (both blog posts built with the Divi Builder and blog posts built with the classic WordPress editor).

The plugin will show the author's gravatar icon by default. Or you can use your own image, just enter the URL of your profile image in Users > Your Profile. You can also specify the URLs for your social networks profiles (only those that you enter will show in your author box).

Other features of this plugin allow you to specify the Name Prefix (you can write e.g. "Author" or "Written by"), Text Color, Background Color and Border Color.

This plugin works with any WordPress theme, but has been developed to work particularly with the Divi theme.

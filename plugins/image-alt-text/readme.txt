The "Image Alt Text" plugin is a simple yet powerful tool that allows website owners and content creators to easily edit the alt tags for images on their website. Alt tags, or alternative text descriptions, are important for both accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) purposes, as they provide a textual description of an image for users who are visually impaired or for search engines that cannot interpret images.

With this plugin, website owner and admins can easily edit alt tags for all images on their website directly from the Plugin Menu. The plugin provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to quickly update alt tags for individual images or copy alt text for all missing images. Additionally, the plugin includes a feature to generate alt tags based on the image file name, saving users time and effort.

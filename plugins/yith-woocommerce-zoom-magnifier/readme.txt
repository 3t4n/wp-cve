YITH WooCommerce Product Gallery & Image Zoom add zoom effect to product images and a customizable image slider.

== Description ==

= Enhance your product images, the key features of your product page =

When we buy on an online shop, our contact with the product is limited: we cannot touch, smell or try it. We exclude some of our senses from the product experience so it’s really important to reproduce the appearance of the product as faithfully as possible using high quality and eye-catching photos of it. Usability research has shown that customers who buy online first check the photos, and only after read the product description. For this reason the product images are considered as the key element of the shopping experience.

The new version of YITH WooCommerce Product Gallery & Image Zoom allows enabling the zoom and a lightbox on your product images to let customers see any detail and, at the same time, manage thumbnails in a handy slider for a clean and modern result in your product pages.

= Main features =

* Enable the zoom on your product images
* Choose the zoom position (inside the main image or external, in the right side)
* Deactivate the zoom on mobile devices
* Set the size of the zoom window
* Choose whether to blur the image while zooming or not
* Show the lightbox on your product images
* Customize colors, size and position of lightbox icon
* Enable the product gallery slider
* Set the number of thumbnails to show in the slider
* Show the slider arrows on hover
* Customize size, colors and shape of the arrows
* Enable the slider autoplay
* Enable the slider as infinite (and choose the style between “Circular” and “Back to 1st”)

> When it comes to track conversions on a WordPress page it’s easy… but if it’s a "dynamic thank you page" is a big problem.<br><br>
> Tracking Code Manager plugin DETECT AUTOMATICALLY your e-commerce plugin (WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads or WP eCommerce) and let you put the conversion pixels every time someone completes a sale on your store.<br>

= THE REAL PROBLEM =

Since almost every service requires some sort of tracking, update, javascript update or other customization - you can make it extremely simply with this plugin - the fast Tracking Code Manager plugin.

= FORGET THE UPDATING PROBLEM =

Its very easy to break your site!  Putting the tracking code directly in the theme files, you risk to lose important trackings or external service integrations when it will be updated.  We have all been there!

With Tracking Code Manager you can forget about this problem also if you will change your theme in the future.  Because we are external to the theme - you have reduced your risk between updates to WordPress and any themes or plugin updates.

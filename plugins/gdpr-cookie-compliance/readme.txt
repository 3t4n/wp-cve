== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I setup your plugin? =
* You can setup the plugin in the WordPress CMS main menu (on the left-hand side) -> GDPR Cookie Compliance. 

= How can I link to the Cookie Settings Screen? =
You can use the following link to display the Cookie Settings Screen window:

[Relative Path - RECOMMENDED]
/#gdpr_cookie_modal

[Absolute Path]
https://www.example.com/#gdpr_cookie_modal
https://www.example.com/your-internal-page/#gdpr_cookie_modal

= Can I use direct link to "Accept" and "Reject" cookies?
* For ACCEPT cookies you can use "#gdpr-accept-cookies" as a link
* For REJECT cookies you can use "#gdpr-reject-cookies" as a link

= The scripts added to the plugin settings are not visible in the page source code. =

= Compatibility with GTM containers =
* Our plugin fully supports GTM consent settings and containers. [More details here](https://support.mooveagency.com/topic/ga-gtm-consent-settings/)

= What are "Strictly Necessary Cookies"? =
* The "Strictly Necessary Cookies", sometimes called Essential Cookies, are cookies that are necessary for your site to function properly.
* For example, we use Strictly Necessary Cookies to save information about which cookies the user consented to.
* We are not storing any sensitive or personal data there, the cookie file contains only one of the following strings:

Disabled state: strictly: 1, thirdparty: 0, advanced: 0
Enabled state: strictly: 1, thirdparty: 1, advanced: 1

= Once I add scripts to this plugin, should I delete them from the website’s code? =
Yes. Once you setup the plugin, you should delete the scripts you uploaded to the plugin from your website’s code to ensure that your scripts are not loaded twice.

= Can I use custom code or hooks with your plugin? =
* Yes, we have implemented hooks that allow you to implement custom code snippets. 
* You will find the list of popular hooks in the plugin setttings: CMS > GDPR Cookie Compliance > Help, Hooks, Filters & Shortcodes

= Does the plugin support subdomains or subfolders on multisite network? =
* Yes, the plugin supports subdomains on the same WordPress Multisite Network.
* This feature is part of our [Premium Add-on](https://www.mooveagency.com/wordpress-plugins/gdpr-cookie-compliance/)
* We can sync users consent across your multisite network as long as your subsites are using the same domain and either folder or subdomain structure.
* For example, if user agrees to cookies on one subsite (example.com/one/ or one.example.com), then we can automatically sync their consent and cookies will be accepted on the other subsites too (example.com/two/ or two.example.com).
* There is only one exception where we cannot sync users consent between subsites and that's when you're using different domains (subdomains are fine). Browsers will treat each domain as separate entity and our plugin will be unable to alter cookies stored by the other domain. This is a security feature in browsers to prevent hacking.

= Does this plugin block all cookies? =
This plugin only restricts cookies for scripts that you have setup in the Settings. If you want to block all cookies, you have to add all scripts that use cookies into the Settings of this plugin. 

= What information does the Consent Log store and where is it stored? = 
* The Consent Log feature stores all data in your website's database. 
* The data stored includes: Consent Date, User's IP address, Cookies Accepted and User Email (for logged-in users)
* You can see the [preview of Consent Log here](https://ps.w.org/gdpr-cookie-compliance/assets/screenshot-36.png?rev=2263873)
 
= Does this plugin guarantee that I will comply with data protection laws?=
This plugin is just a template and needs to be setup correctly in order to work properly.
THIS PLUGIN DOES NOT MAKE YOUR WEBSITE COMPLIANT. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ARE MET ON YOUR WEBSITE.

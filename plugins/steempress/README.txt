== Frequently Asked Questions ==

For all the questions related to Hive please see:
https://hive.blog/faq.html or https://hive.io

**What's the difference between wordpress.com and wordpress**

Wordpress is the blogging platform on which you run steempress.
Wordpress.com is a business providing hosting for wordpress blogs.

**Do I need a wordpress.com business account ?**

No, you can use any web hosting provider to host your blog and use steempress.
Wordpress.com is providing a free hosting service but to use plugins you have to upgrade to the highest plan which is
very expensive compared to other plans.

We recommend the webhosting plan from ovh : https://www.ovh.com/ but you are free to use any other host.

We also recommend you to pick the "one click wordpress install" option which will directly install wordpress on your
server.

**What kind of server do I need**

It all depends on your blog and how much it'll be visited, but you really shouldn't need a lot of data.

For instance the "personal" plan on ovh with 100gb of disk space is more than enough for most of the use cases.

**Do I need a domain name**

No. Although having one is way better for your SEO. And generally more pretty.

Nobody says "hey have you heard of 173.245.234.11 ?" they say "hey have you heard of mysuperblog.com ?"

**Can I use a free domain or a subdomain ?**

Yes.


**How can I protect the SEO of my website/will the SEO of my blog be affected ?**

The delay feature allow you to publish first on your blog and then publish to hive after a few days/hours/minutes (you decide the delay). Which means that google and other search engines will index your blog first and tag hive.blog as a duplicate. And so your blog's seo ranking won't be hurt.
We recommend a 7 days delay for maximum security.


**I did not get a vote on my article, is something wrong ?**

You will not automatically get a vote, consider a vote as a tip for producing good content with us. You don't expect
a tip, but you are happy when you get one. The same mentality applies.

**Who do I talk to about business and parnerships ?**

Find @fredrikaa on the official steempress discord and talk to him

the discord can be found here : https://discord.gg/W2KyAbm

**Who do I talk to about technical details, bugs etc ?**

don't talk to @howo directly unless it's a very specific and urgent problem, instead feel free to use the
help and suggestion channels.

Still on the discord : https://discord.gg/W2KyAbm

**I published my post on wordpress but it was not published on hive what's up ?**

Check the plugin settings to make sure that you have set everything correctly. you should see

"Connectivity to the hive server : Ok
Username/posting key : Ok
"

If that's ok, look at the delay, did you put any delay ? And is that delay over ?

If all of that checks, then something went wrong, come in the #help channel and we'll figure it out.

**Can I use this on my phone**

We got that question a lot so I feel like we need to answer it.

No. You need a wordpress blog which needs to be hosted. So you can buy hosting with your phone and manage it
still from your phone but you'll have to go by the "hosting" section and get a blog there.


**At what percentages are the beneficiaries set  ?**

15%

**Benefactor rewards**

Like most other apps on hive, including esteem, dtube, dsound, dmania and zappl to name a few, Swe use benefactor rewards to help run and develop SteemPress. The benefactor reward is currently set to 15%. To compensate, SteemPress is able to support original authors who post quality content with our hive account @steempress-io.

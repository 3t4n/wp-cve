== Description ==
Easily add a custom top bar notification message to on your site with live customization options via the WordPress customizer. The plugin allows you to enter your notification bar text as well as an optional button to display next to your text. Perfect for notifying visitors of a current sale, hot product, warnings or other important messages.

The [Easy Notification Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-notification-bar/) plugin makes use of the newer "wp_body_open" action hook introduced in WordPress 5.2.0 which allows the plugin to work better with any theme that has been updated to support the tag. Contrary to other notice bar solutions which rely on absolute positioning, this plugin inserts the notice bar right after the body tag so it should display perfectly without any conflicts on any well-coded theme.

By default, the notification bar is "static" which means it displays at the top of your site so when you scroll down the page it will become "hidden". This is generally better for usability and [SEO](https://www.wpexplorer.com/wordpress-seo/). However, in version 1.4 we added a new **sticky option** which you can enable in the Customizer so that the notification bar remains visible as you scroll down the page. The sticky functionality makes use of the CSS sticky property (not javascript).

Although disabled by default, you can enable a **close icon** for your notice. When enabled, your visitors will see an "x" icon over the top bar which they can click to hide the message for their current and future sessions. This functionality makes use of localStorage (not cookies). You can also select to hide the notification bar when clicking the call to action button.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't the notification display on my site even though I enabled it? =
This plugin makes use of the WordPress core ["wp_body_open"](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_body_open/) action hook which should be added to every theme header.php file and was introduced in Wordpress 5.2.0. You will need to properly add this action hook to your header.php file and or contact the theme developer so that your theme is updated accordingly.

Feel free to ask in the support forum if you need help updating your header.php file. If you are using a free theme on WordPress.org please link to the theme in question. If you are using a premium theme, contact the developers for support since you paid for it.

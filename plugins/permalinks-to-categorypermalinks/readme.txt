The plugin automatically redirects users who have accessed a blog post link without the category to the one which has the category and therefore avoiding page not found (404) errors.

== Description ==

If you have an existing website and you want to add category to your blog posts links (e.g. by using: /%category%/%postname%/ in Settings > Permalinks) then your visitors
will most likely run into page not found errors. This plugin checks for such post links and redirects the visitor using permanent (301) redirect to the correct /Category/Permalink link IF the permalinks are setup.

This plugin assumes that you have previously used /%postname%/ in your Settings > Permalinks.

This plugin lets you easily remove the page title from specific pages or posts. The basic case scenario is to be
able to hide the title that you will be setting for your "Home" page.

This plugin is built to work only for the [Storefront theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront)

**How to use:**

1. To hide the title for a certain page, you need to login to your WordPress dashboard, and edit the page that you want to hide the title.
2. On the edit page, scroll down until you see the Title and Toggle meta box. Check "Hide Title" checkbox and update your page.
3. After the page has been updated, check your page to see if the title has been successfully removed.

There is also an option to remove the post meta (tags and comment count) for posts.


== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file and upload the storefront-title-toggle folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. In your WordPress dashboard, go to plugins and activate "Storefront Title Toggle" plugin.
3. When editing a post or a page, scroll down until you see the Title Toggle metabox. Check "hide title" to hide the page you are editing.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Will this plugin work for themes other than Storefront?**

The settings for this plugin is a per page/post basis. The functionality can be accessed in the bottom part of every page/post and needs to be set individually.

This is not possible currently, but we will be adding the functionality on the next version.

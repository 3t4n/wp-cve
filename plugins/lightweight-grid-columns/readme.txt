== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add the shortcodes? =

* Make sure Lightweight Grid Columns is activated.
* While editing your post or page, go into the "Visual Editor".
* Look for the columns icon (see screenshots tab).
* Choose your desktop, tablet and mobile grid widths.
* If you're adding the last column in a row, check the "Last" checkbox (this is important).

= What if I don't want to use the TinyMCE button? =

Fair enough! Simply add the shortcode to your content.

For example, the below will output 4 columns on desktop, 2 columns on tablet and 1 column on mobile

	[lgc_column grid="25" tablet_grid="50" mobile_grid="100"]Some content[/lgc_column]

	[lgc_column grid="25" tablet_grid="50" mobile_grid="100"]Some content[/lgc_column]

	[lgc_column grid="25" tablet_grid="50" mobile_grid="100"]Some content[/lgc_column]

	[lgc_column grid="25" tablet_grid="50" mobile_grid="100" last="true"]Some content[/lgc_column]

Take note of our last column - see the last="true" part? Don't forget ;)

= What are my options for percentages? =

This is taken directly from (http://unsemantic.com):

There are grid classes named grid-x where "x" is a number that represents the percentage width of each grid unit. These cover multiples of 5, up to 100 (grid-5, grid-10 ... grid-95, grid-100). There are also classes for dividing a page into thirds: grid-33 and grid-66 which are 33.3333% and 66.6667% wide, respectively.

= Are there any other options I can use in the shortcode? =

Yes!

You can use:

= class =

	[lgc_column grid="25" tablet_grid="50" mobile_grid="100" class="push-25"]Some content[/lgc_column]

= style =

	[lgc_column grid="25" tablet_grid="50" mobile_grid="100" style="padding-left:0px;"]Some content[/lgc_column]

= equal_heights =

By default, JS equal heights are set to "true".

    [lgc_column grid="25" tablet_grid="50" mobile_grid="100" equal_heights="true"]Some content[/lgc_column]

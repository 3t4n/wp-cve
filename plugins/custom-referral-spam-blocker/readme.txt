Custom Referral Spam Blocker gives you the control to ensure that dishonest referral sources are blocked from Google Analytics.

== Description ==

Custom Referral Spam Blocker gives you the control to ensure that dishonest referral sources are blocked from Google Analytics.

We provide a strong default set of spam referral sources and block them for you.  Referrers can quickly be added in moments using the WordPress Dashboard.

*At this time, we are unable to block referral spam when used in conjunction with most CDN configurations.*

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use the Custom Referral Spam Blocker Settings screen to manage referral sources.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I customize my list and new default sources are added, will my list be updated? =

Future versions are planned with improved support for appending to default versus replacing it with your own list.

= What is the correct way to add new domains to the block list? =

This plugin blocks requests for all pages from a given domain or subdomain. Each domain should be added on a new line. For example, if you add "imaspammerandimok.com" to the list, requests with referrers such as "http://imaspammerandimok.com/spamallnight/spamallday.html" will also be blocked.  Do not include the protocol (https://, http://) or path (/folder/page.html) when adding new domains. Subdomains, however, must currently be entered individually.

= What happens to the evil spammers? =

Their requests are intentionally blocked from continuing to load any WordPress code and get directed away from your site. If they have a puppy, it cries.

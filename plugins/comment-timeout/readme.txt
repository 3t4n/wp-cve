Tags: comments, spam
Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 3.2
Stable tag: 2.4.1

Closes comments on blog entries after a user-configurable period of time, with an option to make allowances for active discussions.

== Description ==

This plugin extends the comment closing functionality in WordPress to allow
you to extend the discussion time when older posts have recent comments
accepted, or to override the comment closing time on a post by post basis.

**Note: PHP 4 is no longer supported.** As of version 2.1, Comment Timeout requires PHP 5.2 or later.
If you are still using PHP 4, you should use Comment Timeout 2.0.1.

== Installation ==

* Copy the directory `comment-timeout` and all the files in it into your
`/wp-content/plugins` directory.
* Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in the WordPress dashboard.
* Configure the plugin by going to the "Comment Timeout" page on the "Options" menu.

== Configuration ==

You can change various settings globally on the "Comment Timeout" page under the
"Options" tab on the WordPress dashboard. Most of the options are fairly
self-explanatory.

You can also change options on a per-post basis by looking for the
"Comment Timeout" section in the sidebar of the post or page editor.

== Template tags ==

Comment Timeout 2.1 introduces two new functions that you can use in your theme:

`get_comment_timeout()`

Returns the UTC time, as a Unix timestamp, when comments will be closed for the current post.

`the_comment_timeout($relative, $dateformat, $before, $after, $moderated)`

Formats and displays the date and time after which comments will no longer be
accepted on this post. Parameters are:

* **$relative**: Set this to `true` if you want to display the date in terms of the time remaining
(for instance "in 3 weeks"). Set it to `false` to display it as an absolute date.
* **$dateformat**: The format in which the date should be displayed, as used by the PHP
`date()` function. If you set this to `false`, it will use the date format that you have configured
globally for your WordPress installation.
  * If `$relative` is set to `true`, this parameter is ignored.
* **$before**: The HTML to insert before the date that comments will be closed.
* **$after**: The HTML to insert after the date that comments will be closed.
* **$moderated**: The HTML to display when late comments are being sent to the moderation queue
rather than being rejected outright.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**My page layout breaks when comments are closed!**

This is the fault of your theme, not this plugin. Some theme authors do not test
their themes properly with posts for which comments have been closed.
See [this blog post](http://jamesmckay.net/2008/07/comment-timeout-and-faulty-wordpress-themes/ "Comment Timeout and faulty WordPress themes") for details.

You should contact your theme developer and ask them for a fix.

== Installation ==

Installing Thrive Automator on your WordPress website is easy. Just choose the method that’s easiest for you…

**A) The easy, recommended method**

Install Thrive Automator directly from the ‘Plugins > Add New’ section of your WordPress dashboard.

**B) The more technical method**

Download Thrive Automator from this page, and upload it to WordPress manually.

**C) The Thrive Suite member method**

If you’re a [Thrive Suite](https://thrivethemes.com/suite/) member, you can simply activate Thrive Automator directly from your Thrive Dashboard. No additional steps needed.

**ACTIVATING THRIVE AUTOMATOR**

Once you have installed Thrive Automator, **don’t forget to activate the plugin** too. All WordPress plugins need to be both installed and activated to work correctly.

You will now see a new **Thrive Automator** menu item in your WordPress dashboard.

Clicking this new menu item will open a welcome screen.

**THE THRIVE AUTOMATOR WELCOME SCREEN**

At this point, you’ll be prompted to install a lightweight plugin called Thrive Product Manager, and connect it with a FREE Thrive Themes account. This allows Thrive Automator to connect with all your favorite apps and services, including WooCommerce and 20+ email marketing services.

All of this is totally free and only takes around a minute.

(You can skip this step, but Thrive Automator will be limited to just the basic WordPress actions and installed 3rd party plugins integrations.)

And you’re ready to start building your own integrations to help grow your website audience and online business!

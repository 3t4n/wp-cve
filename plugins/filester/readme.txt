###🔑 HOW IT WORKS

Filester plugin helps you easily manage WordPress files so that you don’t have to access directories via FTP or cPanel. 

This plugin creates a new menu **File Manager** in your WordPress dashboard. From then on, you can view all server files, configuration files, and media files on your current WordPress website.

You can edit, copy, upload/download files/folders to your server from File Manager section. This toolbar is similar to the settings in an FTP client. It allows you to preview, edit, upload, download, duplicate and delete files or folders.

All webmasters can also [download WordPress media library](https://ninjateam.org/download-wordpress-media-library/) using Filester download options as well.

###🎏 COMPATIBILITY

Filester works seamlessly with all major WordPress themes, page builders, and website builders.

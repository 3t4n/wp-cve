Adds a Honeypot and a clean image captcha to Gravity Forms. Images are made using Font Awesome's font icon.

== Description ==

Adds a honeypot and an image captcha to your Gravity Forms by adding the Image Captcha from the Advanced Fields in the Gravity Forms editor where you want the captcha to appear. This CAPTCHA is GDPR compliant and becuase the images are inline SVG's, this plugin will not slow down your site with additional header requests like Google's ReCAPTCHA.

= Why WooCommerce catalog mode is necessary for your store? =
There may be instances where you may consider revising product prices, updating your stocks, do not wish to display product prices to certain type of users, or are running into maintenance issues. In these cases, there are chances that your site traffic might drop, or even worse, you could lose your potential customers. Hence it would be ideal for your site to turn into WooCommerce catalog mode, so that you don’t lose your customers’ interest. A simple solution would be to let your customers know about the status of the product, by using a custom message, instead of order button.

Simply search for the plugin name via the **Plugins -> Add New** dialog and click install, or download and extract the plugin, and copy the plugin folder into your wp-content/plugins directory and activate.

After installation you can add shortcodes by clicking on the new icons appearing in the Classic Editor (Visual Mode): most of the shortcodes are added by clicking the "W" icon in the editor, while the Slideshow Shortcode can be added by clicking on the small icon with a landscape.
Shortcodes work also in Gutenberg, and are available only in the Classic Editor block.

A free all-in-one marketing plugin that allows you to easily use popups, live chat, site tracking and email marketing on your WordPress site. If you’re already a Gist user, the plugin lets you connect your Gist account to your website without any code.

== Description ==

*Gist All-In-One Marketing is the ultimate free plugin for WordPress if you want to grow your email list, manage your contacts, and send marketing emails all through Gist’s free CRM.*

The free plugin includes lead capture tools like popups, live chat, chatbots, knowledge base, email marketing and an integrated free contact database (CRM). Once you grow your email list you can also send email campaigns and manage your digital ads through Gist. All these features work immediately with no developer help needed.

A few of our exhaustive features that will help you capture more leads and grow your email list:

*Popups: To grow your email list*

Create beautiful popups using professionally designed and proven to convert, prebuilt popup and optin templates that you can customize to start converting leads in seconds or build your own with a completely blank canvas using easy-to-use drag and drop popup builder.

You can choose from five types of WordPress forms:

- Inline form: A form you can embed directly on your site pages
- Popup modals: Center screen popups that appear on top of page content
- Top banners: Small banners at the top of the page
- Slide-in boxes: Small boxes that slide in from the side or bottom of the page
- Welcome mats: Full-screen call to actions that shows when visitors land on your site

Using our exit intent technology, advanced page-level targeting, powerful segmentation engine and behavior automation, you can show the perfect popup offer to the right people at the exact right time and maximize your website conversions.

If you’re already using a WordPress form tool on your site, Gist will automatically capture form submissions and add them to your contact database so you can manage them in one place. The plugin supports the popular form plugins like Gravity Forms, MailChimp Forms, Ninja Forms, WPForms, Contact Form 7, and more.

*Live Chat & Chatbots: Let your site visitors talk to you*
	
Gist allows you to embed a <a href="https://getgist.com/live-chat-software/live-chat?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&utm_campaign=wordpress&utm_medium=marketplaces" target="_blank">free live chat</a> widget to your Wordpress site and empower your customers with the quickest and most effective form of contact. Research shows that live chat can boost sales by as much as 40%. Next time your customer faces an issue, they won’t go to the competitors or waste time -- they’ll contact you.

Using the plugin, you can set up the following WordPress live chat modules:
- Support live chat: Answer questions your customers might have about your business through live chat
- Sales live chat: Help answer questions your potential customers might have through live chat
- Automated chatbot: Set up an automated chatbot to respond to your website visitors when you aren’t online to respond to live chat messages

And Gist offers free iOS, Android apps to stay connected with your prospects and customers while on the move.

*Email Marketing*

Send beautiful looking emails to your contacts. Our email builder allows you to create responsive and stunning emails and analyze your email performance to see how each contact interacted with your email.

You can send an automated email when someone fills out a form, submits a popup form, or sends a message on live chat. Automated emails are helpful for engaging with your subscribers and customers at the time that matters most: when they’re engaging with you. All emails you send including open and click rates, will be automatically logged in the integrated WordPress CRM so you can see exactly who opens and clicks your emails.

You’ll be able to do things like:

- Collect subscribers from any page with Gist's popup forms
- Identify your contacts and their time zones
- Apply tags and trigger automations when one of your contacts visits a page
- Add trigger to kick off automations when someone clicks a link
- See exactly what pages a contact has visited and when
- Score leads using page visit analytics

And that’s in addition to all the other email and automation features that come with Gist, like:

- Facebook Custom Audiences and Facebook Lead Ads
- Autoresponders, campaigns, broadcasts, newsletters, and more
- Easy segmentation, personalization, and dynamic Liquid content
- An amazing visual workflow builder
- Advanced integrations to track revenue, fix cart abandonment, and beyond
- Person-based (not list-based) contact management and built-in list pruning

*Built-in Analytics: To improve your conversions*
	
Built-in analytics makes it clear which pages and traffic sources drive the most conversions so you can keep doing what’s working.

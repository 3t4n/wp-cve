= Why should I use a chatbot and not a contact form? =

Contact forms are static by nature. Adding a form to a chatbot on a site is similar to how you would put a donation box in a sales store and just hopes that people will donate. Unfortunately that doesn’t happen. You need to be proactive and that’s exactly what chatbots can do. They capture the attention of the user in a gentle manner and gets to know them. Then slowly the bot is able to progress the conversation and get all the details you need and still end up delivering a great user experience. There are plugins that can help you set up contact forms, but only FlowCharts.ai can help you make interactive bots for your website and serve as a contact form at the same time!

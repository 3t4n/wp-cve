Random cards generation by Emotional Online Storytelling


== Description ==

Random cards generation by Emotional Online Storytelling.


Our Oracle Cards WordPress plugin gives you the possibility to integrate an interactive deck of cards onto your WordPress website.

In the following video you can see the PRO version in action.


[vimeo https://player.vimeo.com/video/474617603]


With the free version a deck can have a maximum of 15 cards and you can choose between 4 predefined backs.


With the <a href="https://emotionalonlinestorytelling.com/oracle-card-wordpress-plugin/">PRO version</a> you have no limits and you can upload a custom back for your decks.


== HOW TO CREATE THE DECK AND ADD IT TO THE PAGE ==

== How to create the deck ==
* Go to Oracle Cards => Oracle Cards => Add New Deck
* Set the deck name and click on “Add New Deck”
* Select the default card back and assign the default card sizes
* Set the card title prefix in the text field, or check the checkbox to get the titles of the uploaded images
* Click on the button “Upload card front images”

== How to add the deck to the page ==
* Go to Main Admin Menu => Oracle Cards
* Copy the shortcode from the last column and put it into the page where you want that it appears (e.g. [oracle_cards deck=”1″])

For more details and to see a description of all the shortcode parameters read the <a href="https://emotionalonlinestorytelling.com/oracle-cards-wordpress-plugin/getting-start/#1601497661350-a4a43257-ed89"> plugin documentation</a>.

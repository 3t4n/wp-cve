Extend Gutenberg Reusable Blocks feature with a complete admin panel, widgets, shortcodes and PHP functions.

== Description ==

Extend Gutenberg Reusable Blocks feature with a complete admin panel, widgets, shortcodes and PHP functions.

This plugin extends the Reusable Blocks admin interface and provides few fancy features:

* Add Reusable Blocks dashboard informations
* Activate Reusable Blocks admin screen
* Provide a list of Posts where each Reusable Block is used and the date it was last modified
* Provide a **live preview of your reusable blocks** from the Reusable Blocks admin screen, with your theme stylesheets
* Provide a Reusable Blocks Widget to use your block anywhere you want in your theme’s widgets areas
* Provide a Reusable Blocks Shortcode to use your block anywhere you want in your Post types (even if they use the Classic Editor rather than Gutenberg!)
* Provide some Reusable Blocks PHP functions to use your block anywhere you want in your theme even

* NEW: An easy tool to convert reusable blocks to block patterns in one click!

For a full presentation of Reusable Blocks Extended, see this [WordCamp Talk synthesis available on my blog](https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/en/2019/12/gutenberg-reusable-blocks-wordcamp-marseille-talk-synthesis/).

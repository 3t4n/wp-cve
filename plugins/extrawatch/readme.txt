See visits and clicks on your website in realtime!

== Description ==
See what's going on on your website in real time. See who's browsing which pages, information about his country, city, device. This is a great way how to see how your website is being used by the users.
See most recent visits on a map, most popular pages, visits from search engines and where your visitors came from. In this version, data are stored in the cloud, and script is loaded asynchronously, so there is no performance impact on your website.
If you're using static plugins like WP Slimstat, this plugin will give you completely different real time experience.

Create your own community with the best social networking plugin for WordPress. Beautiful user profiles, activity stream, notifications, member listing, blog posts integration with comments, reactions, hashtags and many more.

== Description ==

PeepSo is a super-light and free **social networking plugin** for WordPress that allows you to quickly and easily add a social network or an online community right inside your WordPress site. PeepSo is highly efficient and user-friendly, similar to Facebook in terms of easy use – but with better productivity.

**Social network for WordPress** – in just a few clicks!

Why would you want to send your users to a Facebook group where they can be targeted by ads from your competition? Why send your users away from your own site? It is hard enough to get quality traffic to your website. With your own community people will keep coming back. Get them to visit your site once, and they will return for other people they met within your own community, as well as for practical features of your website that keep them engaged.

== PEEPSO FREE BUNDLE ==
Our PeepSo Free Bundle, designed to set any community to an amazing start. It is truly and completely FREE and at your disposal! When we say it's free, it's actually free. No signup. No credit card. No hassle.

== Developers ==
Check out our GitLab repository of our [PeepSo Hello World Plugin](https://gitlab.com/PeepSo/Public/HelloWorld). It's a great starting point for your own PeepSo plugins. It showcases how things connect and comes with well documented code.

== PeepSo Theme: Gecko ==
The same team that created PeepSo and its plugins had also created the theme: Gecko.
Relying on third party themes pushes everything out of our hands; no control over the actual display - not entirely anyway. So a proof of concept was created, and we've received amazing feedback from the community. With Gecko we have close to limitless possibilities to showcase PeepSo and its plugins in the most stunning way. You can get the theme here: [PeepSo Theme: Gecko](https://www.peepso.com/features/#gecko). Gecko Theme is included in every single one of our bundles.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is PeepSo GDPR Compliant? =

PeepSo does have the options and configuration settings that will help you as a responsible site administrator to meet the obligations and rights enacted under the GDPR. Please note that the built-in configuration options for the GDPR cover only PeepSo plugins. Should you use any other 3rd party software that also needs to be GDPR compliant, it needs to be covered by its respective developers. PeepSo does NOT cover 3rd party solutions under its GDPR compliance features. As a responsible site administrator you yourself must ensure that any and all parts of your website are GDPR compliant, according to the law. 

= Can I use my existing theme? =

We've tested PeepSo with dozens of major themes. But since there are thousands of themes for WordPress, it is hard for us to test with all of them. Well, virtually impossible. The theme we recommend is [PeepSo Theme: Gecko](https://www.peepso.com/downloads/peepso-theme-gecko/) - it's a theme developed by the same team that makes PeepSo plugins and it can take your community to the next level. It is beyond anything 3rd party themes can offer with PeepSo. The theme is included for free in every single one of our bundles.

Having that said, you can check PeepSo with the 3rd party theme and if you find any problems, please report them and we'll fix whatever PeepSo might be breaking. However, if 3rd party theme itself is interfering with PeepSo's styles and overriding them in any way, there's nothing we'd be able to do - we can fix only what we've made ourselves. You'd have to contact the theme developers to get it fixed.

= Where do I find translations? =

Translations are included within the plugin.

= Is there documentation available for PeepSo? =

Yes! You can find documentation on the use of PeepSo and its plugins at [PeepSo Docs](https://docs.peepso.com/)

= How do I report a bug/problem and get technical support? =

We encourage you to open a support ticket here: [Contat Us](https://www.peepso.com/contact/). Our support operates Monday – Friday 9AM – 5PM (GMT+8). [PeepSo Ultimate Bundle Subscribers](https://www.peepso.com/features/)* get access to 24/7 support coverage. We reply to the majority of requests in less than 24 hours, but although we do our best it can take us up to 48 hours to get back to you (72 hours if the request was made just before or during the weekend).

== Upgrade Notice ==

Upgrades can be performed in two ways. The automatic upgrade system lets you click a button on each plugin to upgrade to the latest available version. Alternatively, you can go to https://PeepSo.com/my-account/ and download the latest versions manually. Deactivate and delete old plugins, upload, and activate new plugins.

For automatic upgrades to work flawlessly, make sure to upgrade all the child plugins first and upgrade PeepSo last. You might need to reactivate the plugins too, once PeepSo is upgraded.

Hide – or show – WordPress Dashboard Notices, Messages, Update Nags etc. ... for everything!

== Description ==

New & improved!

Have you become tired of the clutter of Admin Notices that appear at the top of every page in your WordPress Dashboard?

With each new plugin or theme that you install, there seem to be more and more notices that appear at the top of each page!

With this simple plugin, you can claim back all this wasted screen space so that you can focus on what is important - creating your content.

Hide Admin Notices hides away all Notices, Messages, and Update Nags, and makes it easy for you to see them again when you want.

#### HOW DOES IT WORK?

After activating the plugin, you will have a new **Show Notices** button at the top right-hand corner of your admin pages - just next to **Screen Options**.

Click the button to reveal all hidden notices, then simply click the button again to hide them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

It hides away all WordPress Dashboard Notices, Messages, and Update Nags that appear at the top of each screen.

You can see these notices at anytime simply by clicking the **Show Notices** button in the top right-hand corner.

To hide all notices again, just click on **Hide Notices**.

= How do I see the hidden Dashboard notices? =

Simply click the **Show Notices** button in the top right-hand corner on the screen.

= How do I hide the Dashboard notices? =

Simply click the **Hide Notices** button in the top right-hand corner on the screen.

= I have no Show Notices button =

Don't worry — this is normal behaviour. The **Show Notices** button appears only when there are hidden notices, thus if you can't see this button, there are no notices that have been hidden.

If, however, there are notices you think should have been hidden and there is no button, please write a message in the [WordPress Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hide-admin-notices/).

= What configuration is there with this plugin? =

None. Simply install, activate and enjoy!

= There is a feature I want! =

Great! Please write a message in the [WordPress Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hide-admin-notices/).

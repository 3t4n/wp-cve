Displays subpages for the current page. Set the depth and starting level (in hierarchy) and you are good to go.

== Description ==
This plugin creates a widget menu of the pages related to the current page. You define where in the page hierarchy 
to be the root of the menu, and you define the depth. Now you have a simple and dynamic navigation menu. 
The benefits with this plugin compared with a predefined menu is that this menu can change from one page to an other.

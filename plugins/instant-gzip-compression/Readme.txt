Speed up your Wordpress website with this Gzip compression plugin.

== Description ==
**About**

This plugin will instantly speed up your Wordpress website when the plugin is activated.
Gzip is the most popular and effective compression method currently available and generally reduces the response size by about 70%!

**Important**
This function changes your .htaccess file. In some cases this might result in a 500 error. If you're not sure whether you can run Gzip ask your hosting company.
The only way to fix this is to be able to edit the .htaccess file from outside Wordpress (via FTP).

**Gzip Checker**
NEW - You can now check if Gzip is enabled for your website. Go to "settings" and select the "Instant Gzip Compression" tab.



== Installation ==

Upload the .zip file with a FTP program in the folder wp-content/plugins or upload via Worpress backend.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What "Categories", "Tags", "Title" and "Meta Key" mean for "Search Related Words in" option on the Related Posts settings page? =

The plugin displays related post depending on your choice:

- if you select "Categories" option, then related posts will be displayed by similar words in categories;
- if you select "Tags" option, then related posts will be displayed by similar words in tags;
- if you select "Title" option, then related posts will be displayed by similar words in the posts and pages titles;
- if you select "Meta Key" option, then related post will be displayed by meta key.

= I chose "Meta Key" in "Search Related Words in" option on Related Posts settings page, but it displays nothing =

After you choose "Meta Key" option, you should complete the following:

1) Go to "All Posts";
2) Choose the post you would like to be displayed by our plugin;
3) Click "edit" button;
4) Find "Related Posts" section;
5) Check "Key" radio button;
6) Update/Publish the post;
7) Repeat all these steps for each post you would like to display as related.

= I have adjusted the Popular Posts settings, and yet nothing is displayed =

You have probably selected 'Views' in 'Order Posts by Number of' option on the plugin settings page. Since the plugin hasn't collected the necessary data yet, there is nothing to display. Once the users start visiting your pages, the plugin will start tracking, and the posts will be displayed in the widget (in the frontend).

= How can I add Featured Post block to my website? =

If you would like to add Featured Posts to your page or post, open the necessary posts or page in the Edit mode and mark "Enable to display this post in the Featured Posts block." checkbox.

There are several ways to add the block, please use one of them:
1. Go to Related Posts settings page, find "Block position" option and mark "Before content" and/or "After content" checkboxes.
2. Copy and paste the following shortcode into your post or page: [bws_featured_post].
3. Copy and paste the following code to the necessary place in your theme:

`<?php do_action( 'ftrdpsts_featured_posts' ); ?>`

= I set the featured image size but the plugin scaled it. How can I crop the image? =

You can manually regenerate thumbnails in any convenient way. We recommend you to use WordPress plugins in order to avoid the mistakes. Please read more here: [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/user-lessons/help-regenerate-thumbnails/)

= I completed the steps you described, but Featured Post block is not displaying yet. Why? =

Please select the necessary posts you would like to display (open the necessary posts or page in the Edit mode and mark "Enable to display this post in the Featured Posts block." checkbox).

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =

Please make sure that the problem hasn't been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem's description:
- The link to the page where the problem occurs.
- The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version - your order number.

An easy to use wordpress plugin,where admin can configure a set of urls to open as popunder in visitor browser upon visitor click, with Cookie Support.

== Description ==

Acurax on click pop under plugin allows administrator to configure a set of website url in the plugin settings..which will open as **pop under** on visitors browser.

A Quick Look

	★ Configure Multiple URLS
	
	★ Random URL is Picked and Open as Pop Under
	
	★ Controlled by Cookie and So Will Open Only Once in a Session
	
	★ Can Configure Cookie Timeout
	
	★ Automatic Integration
	
	★ Easy to Configure

It will open only once per cookie session. There is also option to configure the **cookie timeout**.

When Pop Under is opening on visitor click, Plugin will save a cookie in visitors browser and so the popunder will not open again until the configured timeout.


**For example** If we set cookie time out to 60 minutes, Pop under will open on visitors click. Once its opened, It will not open again for the next 60 minutes.

Spruce up your links with subtle CSS3 styles. Discrete control of underline, background, and text colors - including underline thickness and offset.

== Description ==

Ever been frustrated at the lack of flexibility for styling your hyperlinks? Ever wondered how sites like Pitchfork and Medium are able to dynamically style their links? If so, Stylish Links is for you! With the click of a button, automatically apply beautiful CSS3 styles to all of the existing links within your post and page content without conflicting with your current theme styles.

Stylish Links gives you full control over your link text, underline, and background colors, and most importantly, independent control over all of the hover effects. You can even control the underline thickness and offset from the bottom of the link text. 

Works in all modern browsers and runs purely from CSS requiring no javascript, so your site remains virtually untouched from a performance perspective. Take a look at the demo here: http://www.industrialthemes.com/plugins/

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/stylish-links` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Stylish Links screen to configure the plugin


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do the link styles show up on my site? =

All links within all of your existing posts are styled, and you can also turn on page content styling as well.

= Will this make my site slower? =

No. It's based purely on CSS3 and requires no javascript, so there is no performance impact.

= What browsers will this work on? =

All major browsers, including IE11 and Microsoft Edge.

= Will this affect all the links on my site? =

No, it will take control of only the links within your post and/or page content containers and will not affect menus or other template specific elements. And you can selectively turn anything off via the plugin options.

= How does it work? =

Uses WordPress hooks and filters to find links and apply a css class which is controlled via the plugin's stylesheet.

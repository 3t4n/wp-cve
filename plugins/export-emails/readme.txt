== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why not exporting the email lists as files? =
The very first implementation of this plugin was actually creating files for download. While it's a very convenient solution, there are security and privacy issues with it. The simple fact of having, even momentarily, a file on your server that contain the email addresses of all your subscribers is a significant risk. Because of that, it was decided against using downloadable files.

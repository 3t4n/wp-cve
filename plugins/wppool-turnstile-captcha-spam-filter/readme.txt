**WHAT IS CLOUDFLARE TURNSTILE, AND HOW TO ACTIVATE IT ON YOUR WEBSITE?**

Turnstile is the latest privacy-focused invisible CAPTCHA technology developed by Cloudflare to create a modern alternative to CAPTCHA. 

**Turnstile helps you identify real website visitors without needing additional actions.** Instead, Turnstile automatically runs a series of small non-interactive JavaScript challenges based on telemetry and client behavior displayed during a session. That means the possibility of your users facing CAPTCHA will reduce significantly.

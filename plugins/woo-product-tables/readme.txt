== Description ==

[Product Table WooCommerce plugin](https://woobewoo.com/plugins/table-woocommerce-plugin/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=wooproducttable "Product Table WooCommerce plugin") allows listing your WooCommerce products in a searchable table layout with filters. It's hugely popular for quick order forms, large product catalogs, restaurant order systems, wholesale layouts, price lists, and more.

Display items in a responsive table, generated automatically, with full control over what's displayed with no coding required. The WooCommerce product table allows you to add product tables anywhere on your site. To list products in a table, just add them to the table with the help of a sortable and searchable form, select the product properties you would like to display as columns, and add a table on any page via a shortcode.

To add the custom field to the product table, you need to [follow these steps](https://woobewoo.com/documentation/how-to-add-custom-fields-to-the-table/ "How to add custom fields to the table"):

This means that you can add products to WooCommerce manually or import them using a CSV/XML import plugin, and they will display in the product table. In this tutorial, you can find an instruction [how to add a product to WooCommerce](https://woobewoo.com/feature/all-products-in-one-table/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=multipleaddtocart&utm_campaign=wooproducttable "How to create a product catalog for your tech shop?")

= How to create an order form?
Order form enables users to quickly scan and compare all your products. Also, it changes how products are displayed in your store.
First of all, the order form lists multiple products all on top of each other in contrast to the standard WooCommerce store, where each good takes up a relatively large amount of space. Such product displays allow customers to quickly see all the important features before they buy it.
Look at detailed instruction [Step by step: how to create add an order form](https://woobewoo.com/blog/step-by-step-how-to-create-an-order-form?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=orderform&utm_campaign=wooproducttable "Step by step: how to create add an order form") to the WooCommerce store.

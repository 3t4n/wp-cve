UPS WooCommerce plugin lets you offer a full range of UPS shipping options. Provide your customers with the automatically calculated shipping rates for numerous UPS services and let them choose their preferred Access Points.

== Description ==

= Most powerful UPS WooCommerce integration =

Provide your customers with the automatically calculated shipping rates for numerous UPS services and let them choose their preferred Access Points. You’ll integrate the plugin in just 5 minutes.

How does it work? Conveniently connect your UPS account with one click using OAuth (REST API). **No need to "create an application" on the UPS website**. Alternatively, you can still use the XML API. The shipping cost is calculated automatically online via UPS API connection, so your clients will see every UPS shipping option in the checkout with its real price. You can **offer delivery to UPS Access Point**, too.

**Give your customers the opportunity to pick up packages when and where it's best for them.** Enable Access Points support to show store customers the option to choose the UPS Access Point service. The plugin suggests the nearest points for the customer's address and saves the point to the customer’s order.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What currencies does the plugin support? =

UPS WooCommerce plugin supports every currency which UPS supports. If UPS doesn’t support a given currency, the UPS WooCommerce plugin won’t show it in the checkout.

= Do I need a UPS account? =
Yes. UPS WooCommerce plugin uses your account to make a connection to the UPS API. You can check the API Status in the settings section. Sign up with UPS quickly and easily [on their site](https://www.ups.com/doapp/SignUp).

= How can I configure UPS services? =

There is an option to enable custom services settings. You can set which services are available for your customers. However, UPS WooCommerce shows only services available for a given customer based on their shipping address and products in the cart.

= What is a fallback cost? =

Sometimes API doesn’t respond or return an error. In that case, the UPS shipping method won't be displayed in the checkout. However, you can set the fallback cost. If it is enabled, the flat rate shipping cost will be displayed in the checkout in case of any API errors.

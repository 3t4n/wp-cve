Makes pages behave more like posts: they have tags, categories, and
excerpts and they are included in post listings, including RSS/Atom feeds.

== Description ==
Adds tags, categories, and excerpts to pages. Also adds pages to most views
that list posts, such as the main view, tag archives, and the rss feed.

The plugin has no settings, does not alter the database and only uses hooks
to achieve its goal. It also should work perfectly fine with Multisite
installations.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `pages-are-posts` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Done!

== Changelog ==

= 1.1 =
* Added manual excerpts to pages.

= 1.0 =
* Initial release.

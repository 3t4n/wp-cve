Instantly add a customizable Call Now Button to your website. Our call now button automatically changes into an Email Us button based on your work schedule.

== Description ==
With our Call Now Button, never miss a potential customer or prospect again by allowing them to instantly call or email you. This plugin places a customizable call now button on the bottom of your pages (when viewed on a mobile device) that allows a visitor to call or email you right from their phone. The plugin also allows you to select hours at which you can receive phone calls and automatically switches the button to email you when you are unavailable by phone.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this plugin cost anything?

No! This plugin is entirely free and we welcome any feature requests. Simply email dev@gethuman.com with the subject "Call Now Button Ultimate Feature Request" for requests

= What kind of phone number do I need to enter?

Any kind of phone number that a mobile phone would understand :) That means with dashes, without dashes, with a "+" sign or without one.

= What are "Hours of Operation"?

We understand that you are not always available by phone. Maybe you work from 9AM to 5PM. Selecting hours of operation between 9AM and 5PM will mean that when your visitors click on the button, they will be prompted to call your phone when it is between 9AM and 5PM and will be prompted to email you when it is before 9AM or after 5PM.

= Can I customize the text and colors of the plugin?

Yes, and we plan on continually adding more customizable features. After you install and activate the plugin, go into the Call Now Button Ultimate settings and scroll to the bottom "Call Now Button Appearance" section. We allow you to change the button label for when you are available by phone ("Open" button label text) or by email ("Closed" button label text). You can even adjust the background color and text color of the button.

= Can I test this on a desktop computer?

Yes! When on desktop, visit your website on a browser and decrease the width of the browser so your site is very "thin". This will create a mobile test environment that will allow you to see the button in action without having to use a mobile device.

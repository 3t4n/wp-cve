= Typical Cases in Force Sells =

Consider these following situations where store owners have a need to create offers that sell additional items as a requisite condition for customers to enjoy the amazing promo prices:

- (1) Laptop maintenance service that costs $60 including a proportional charge of $5 for a computer cleaning kit.
- (2) A mobile phone’s screen repair service costs $45 and this includes a charge of $10 for a new tempered glass.
- (3) A wedding photography package that charges $300 includes $60 of a 50-page wedding album. Customers can choose one among various given types for their album.
- (4) A mobile/web application that is for sale at $65; this entails the access to a package of 6-month one-on-one support.
- (5) Purchase a song from the digital store enables customers to get a 3-month license of single VIP membership for free.
- (6) Buy a laptop and get a 30% discount on purchasing a one-year antivirus software license. The brand of software is up to the buyer’s choice.
- (7) A car with an extended two-year auto warranty at an amazing price, while the normal one-year warranty package is already 40% higher. Customers can choose to increase the warranty period up to 4 years, 6 years, 8 years by purchasing.
- (8) A vacation package that has various options for beds: single, couple or double beds.

The force-sell items can be a single product or variable products as in (3), (7) & (8).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is upgrading to Pro mandatory? =

No, not at all. However, it took our company 5 years to build the *Pro* version and we are willing to spend a lot more years of work on this software. We encourage you to evaluate the free version first, and then upgrade to Pro to unlock its potential.

= Why some functions are not available in the free version? =

We make money by selling licenses of the Pro version because our goal is to keep Vik Appointments the best solution for those who need to use it everyday for their business. Maintaining and always developing new features is a heavy cost for our company.

= Is it worth upgrading to Pro? =

Vik Appointments is not a one-page plugin. You can build websites worth a lot of money thanks to this plugin. You don't need anything else to deliver a complete website, if not a Theme and some experience with WordPress.

= Can I build a portal? =

You can do that with the Pro version, but it depends on what type of portal you need.
If you are working on a project for a portal with independent employees, like a network of doctors, baby-sitters, hair stylists or any other professional, then Vik Appointments is the right choice.
However, multiple vendors, like companies that should be able to manage several of their employees (but not all), are not supported. This means that employees can either be managed by the website administrators, or by themselves through their accounts. Not by some sort of groups or companies.

= Can I use Vik Appointments with my preferred Theme? =

Yes, of course. You are free to install Vik Appointments on your website with your own Theme. The plugin will adjust to it thanks to its own CSS framework. It is also possible to work on a custom CSS file to adjust some layouts.

= Will I lose any contents if I upgrade to Pro? =

Absolutely not. Upgrading to the Pro version is a simple and smooth process. You won't lose any data from your current configuration.

= Is Google Calendar syncing supported? =

Yes it is, if you are using VikAppointments 1.2.5 or an higher version.

Alternatively, Vik Appointments only supports one-way syncing with any ICS Calendar, such as Google or Apple iCal. You can tell your calendar system to import the reservations from Vik Appointments by using the apposite calendar subscription URL of the plugin.
However, Vik Appointments will not sync with such external calendar URLs. For example, if you create an event from your Google Calendar, this won't be listed in Vik Appointments.

Anyhow, you can achieve something similar by connecting the **API** framework of VikAppointment to **Zapier**, a third-party system able to dispatch certain web hooks at specific trigger events.

== What customers say about us ==
>**Excellent Plugin / Solid Customer Support!**
> I'm pleased with this plugin for creating different feeds. I started with the free version that allowed me to create just a feed for Google Shopping. That worked well. Then I needed to create some additional feeds so I purchased the Pro version which I feel was reasonably priced. I did need to turn to support for assistance on different feed issues along the way and in each instance they successfully responded in one business day. Overall, the 'WooCommerce Google Feed Manager' plugin is reliable and so is their customer support.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why should I go with your plugin? =
We are very proud of our WooCommerce Google feed manager and we think it is the most powerful plugin out there built by Product Feed Marketeers, especially for WooCommerce-powered shops. Our plugin will help you to get the most out of your Google shopping account.

The power of the plugin is that you can add the data from your shop to any feed attribute required, recommended, or supported by Google. Next to that, you are able to alter the data from your WordPress WooCommerce database so you can optimize the data you send to Google. We support custom product fields and product variations making our plugin even stand out more from the competition.

While you grow with your webshop you can start working with our Premium plugin for even more powerful features and even more channels to sell your products on.

= How does the Google Feed Manager plugin work? =
Basically, the plugin will generate an XML product feed valid for the Google product feed guidelines. It will take the data from your WooCommerce-powered online shop and create a valid Google product feed. The plugin will automatically update the feed to reflect the changes of your products so the XML feed will contain the correct product data. 

The only thing you have to do is add the XML feed URL to your Merchant Center and start selling in Google.

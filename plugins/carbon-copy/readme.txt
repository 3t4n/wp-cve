Copy pages, posts, menus, widgets and more quickly and conveniently.

== Description ==

Are you ready to increase your productivity? The Carbon Copy WordPress plugin will allow you to quickly and conveniently copy your pages, posts, menus, widgets and even your custom post types. You can quickly copy, bulk copy and copy straight to new drafts.  

WordPress v5.8 introduces a new Block based widgets page which integrates the ability to duplicate widgets. Thus the widgets copy feature within Carbon Copy is no longer needed.  

However, some may wish to revert their widgets page back to the traditional widgets. If so, Carbon Copy 1.2.6 now has an option permitting you to disable the new Block based widgets within WordPress v5.8 and restoring the traditional way in which you managed your widgets as well as copied them using the plugin.  

Carbon Copy has many other useful settings to customize its behavior, restrict its use to certain roles or post types and will increase your productivity. For more information check out the plugin documentation on [the plugin's site](https://endurtech.com/carbon-copy-wordpress-plugin/).  

Carbon Copy does not display any annoying ads or pop-ups and does not collect any information outside your WordPress installation. Carbon Copy is 100% GDPR compliant.

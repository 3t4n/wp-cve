== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What is the MPG plugin for?**

The [Multiple Pages Generator](https://themeisle.com/plugins/multi-pages-generator/?utm_source=plugin-readme&utm_medium=mpg&utm_campaign=description) plugin is perfect for creating an unlimited number of landing pages with personalized content and searchable URLs from easily manageable templates and database files (offline or online).

**How does it work?**

When a URL is requested by your browser, the first priority is to load an actual existing page or post. If it doesn't exist, before returning 404, MPG will check if the URL is within its database. If it is, it will render the selected template page, replace all URL related data and shortcodes, return status 200, and load the page for the end-user.

**Is there a tutorial?**

Yes, check out our tutorial videos and step-by-steps at [https://docs.themeisle.com/collection/1572-multiple-pages-generator](https://docs.themeisle.com/collection/1572-multiple-pages-generator?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme)

**Is the MPG plugin free?**

You can use the main features of the plugin for free to create one project. To create an unlimited amount of projects, you can upgrade your plan. Check out our incredible deals here: [Multi Pages Generator](https://themeisle.com/plugins/multi-pages-generator/?utm_source=plugin-readme&utm_medium=mpg&utm_campaign=mainfeatures)

**How does MPG help with my SEO?**

The MPG plugin can create pages with customized keywords that help your site rank higher for each search. You can include specific addresses for each page, localizing your content, and making your page a priority for users in that area. And every metadata can be edited to suit the content of each of the thousands of new pages created.

On top of that, MPG allows you to create sitemaps with all your new URLs and automatically submit to search engines for indexing.


**What if my URL is showing a 404?**

First, make sure the plugin is properly installed, the CSV is loaded and the template is properly set. If the problem persists:

1. Check that the requested URL doesn&#39;t belong to an existing page, especially in the trash.

2. Check that the requested URL is identically included in the data file uploaded to the MPG plugin.

3. Make sure to disable any custom 404-page plugins. Sometimes they check the page URL in the database before MPG does and return 404.

4. Still getting the error message? Write to support **[here.](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/multiple-pages-generator-by-porthas)**

Small fixes. Testing on the latest WP version.

= 1.0.1 =
Added new functionality that allows you to filter the results as well as group the filtered results. You can use the new shortcode that allows you to do this: [mpg where='' group=''][/mpg]. In the "where" parameter you need to specify the name of the column and the value by which you need to filter. Example: where='mpg_column_name=value' or for multi column filter just use comma like where='mpg_column_name=value, mpg_column_name2=value2,...,mpg_column_name7=value7'. Filtered results can be grouped by the value of any of the columns. Example: group='mpg_column_name'. For filtered data, you can specify your HTML pattern, just insert HTML code inside shortcode like this: [mpg]<p>{{column_name}}</p>[/mpg]. Full example of new shortcode look like: [mpg where='mpg_state=NY' group='mpg_city']<p>{{city}}</p>[/mpg]

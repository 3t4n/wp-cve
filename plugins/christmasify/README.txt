Christmasify is an easy-to-use Christmas plugin that can add snow, santa, decorations, music and a lovely Christmas font to your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Christmasify is an easy-to-use Christmas plugin that can add snow, santa, decorations, music and a lovely Christmas font to your WordPress website. All the effects are togglable so you can choose the ones you want. 

In order to keep the plugin light weight and high performance, unfortunately IE8 or lower is not supported. The snow uses CSS3 animation and as such is not compatible with IE9. Unfortunately this plugin requires *PHP 5.4 or greater*. If you would still like to use the plugin please get in touch and we can provide you with a JavaScript snippet to use.

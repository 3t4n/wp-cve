<p><strong>Question: What is the shortcode and will this plugin allow me to display my tracks using the SoundCloud player anywhere on the front-end of my site including widget areas?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
<br />To display the soundcloud player widget on a post or page simply use the following shortcode:</p>
<p><strong>[soundcloud_ultimate track=http://soundcloud.com/yoursoundcloudname/your-track-name]</strong></p>
<p>If you want to display a SoundCloud player in the WordPress widget area you simply need to place the above
shortcode inside a "text" widget.
(Note: you can easily get the value of your "track" url from the plugin's administration page by going to the "Manage Tracks" tab and copying the "Track URL" value)

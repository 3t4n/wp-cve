        Strong Customer Authentication (<a href="https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication" target="_blank">SCA</a>) is required for this payment. The cardholder's bank has rejected the Mail Order / Telephone Order (<a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/mail-order-telephone-order-moto-transactions-when-to-categorize-transactions-as-moto" target="_blank">MOTO</a>) exemption. This means that the customer will have to visit your website to pay for the order.

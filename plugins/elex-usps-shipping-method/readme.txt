ELEX USPS Shipping Method for WooCommerce helps to automate USPS (US Postal Service) shipping integration.

Based on the postal codes and other parameters, all available shipping services along with the rates are listed for the customers to choose from.

Once the USPS plugin is installed and configured with the necessary information (please visit the installation section for more info), your WordPress/WooCommerce Shop will be ready to ship using the USPS. This plugin will add the USPS shipping method as one of the shipping methods in WooCommerce.

While checking out, your customer is presented with the available shipping services and the rates based on the shipping address and cart content.

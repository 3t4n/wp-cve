### Flexible Invoices in a nutshell

Flexible PDF Invoices for WooCommerce & WordPress is a plugin for invoicing in WooCommerce. You can use it to invoice orders in your WooCommerce store. Also, it perfectly runs in a standalone WordPress, so you can invoice your services directly in the WordPress dashboard.

★★★★★

PRO version automates issuing WooCommerce PDF invoices. The plugin lets you create three types of documents - invoice, proforma, and correction invoice. If you need more info on your WooCommerce invoice, you may add additional notes as well.

The PRO version will help you issue invoices under the MOSS and OSS procedure too! Individual customers will receive documents with the proper EU VAT number and VAT on the invoice. The business buyers will get reverse charge PDF invoices for WooCommerce orders thanks to the automatic EU VAT number validation in the checkout.

The PRO version supports WooCommerce integration with many features like full EU VAT support for the vat invoice. The plugin generates WooCommerce PDF invoices automatically with full support for EU transactions. Also, thanks to the plugin, you may issue manual invoices in WordPress and a WooCommerce invoice any time you want. See how easy it is to configure the plugin, generate, send, and download invoices :)

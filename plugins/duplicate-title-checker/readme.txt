This plugin provides alert message for duplicate post title and unique post title when adding new post.

== Description ==

Wordpress allows to enter same title for multiple posts. Sometimes we already used a title and we are not aware of that and when we create another post with same name, wordpress by default is not providing alert that this title is already used.
The benefit of default functionality is that wordpress allows multiple posts with same title and automatically generate unique URLs for duplicate posts which is very helpful.

But what if we need that each post should have unique post title and there are huge number of posts already created ?

In this case this plugin can be used to check that title we are using for new post is unique or not. Right now this plugin is only for post but with minor modification it can be used with custom post types and pages. Although this plugin allows to create multiple posts with same title as it just provides alert that the title used is not unique

If you need any information on plugin and suggestions for how to customize for custom post types or pages than please let us know here [https://www.webconfines.com/contact-us](https://www.webconfines.com/contact-us)

# Paytrail for WooCommerce
[Paytrail](https://www.paytrail.com) payment service for [WooCommerce](https://www.woocommerce.com)

**Required WordPress version:** 4.9<br>
**Required WooCommerce version:** 3.5<br>
**Required PHP version:** 7.3

**[Paytrail](https://www.paytrail.com)** is a payment gateway that offers 20+ payment methods for Finnish customers.

The payment gateway provides all the popular payment methods with one simple integration. The provided payment methods include but are not limited to credit cards, online banking and mobile payments.

To use this extension, you need to sign up for a Checkout Finland account. Transaction fees will be charged for every transaction. Transaction cost may vary from merchant to merchant, based on what is agreed upon with Checkout Finland when negotiating your contract. For more information and to register, please visit [our website](https://www.paytrail.com) or contact [asiakaspalvelu@paytrail.com](mailto:asiakaspalvelu@paytrail.com) directly.

We employ the industry's best security practices and tools to maintain bank-level security for merchants and end customers. Paytrail is PCI DSS Level I and GDPR compliant. 

Upon checkout, customers are redirected to the Paytrail payment service. The customer enters his or her payment information directly into our secure environment so that the web shop never comes into contact with the customers payment data. Once the payment process is complete, customers will redirected back to your store. Tokenization is used to run transactions with stored payment information. No confidential card data is ever stored on your server.

## Updating from Checkout Finland

***Checkout Finland for WooCommerce plugin has been deprecated.*** <br />
All of its functionality now exists as the rebranded Paytrail for WooCommerce plugin.

### Update instructions
1. Install Paytrail for WooCommerce *(see previous chapter)*
2. Go to WooCommerce Settings and open `Payments` tab
3. Disable the old Checkout Finland for WooCommerce payment method

***Warning!*** Removing previous plugin results in payments made with Checkout Finland not refundable through WooCommerce. Payments can still be refunded through Paytrailâ€™s Extranet.

Please also note that the module configurations will not carry over from the old plugin. You will need to reapply them yourself. This also applies to the payment page customizations. Certain classes, functions and CSS classes have also been renamed and any third party customizations will have to be revised.

You can move card tokens from the old plugin by enabling Token migration in the new plugin's settings. This will also update tokens for the WooCommerce Subscriptions orders, if module is in use.

## Configuration

There are several settings you can configure via the options page.

### Test mode

If test mode is enabled, your store will automatically use Paytrail's [test credentials](https://paytrail.github.io/api-documentation/#/?id=test-credentials).

### Debug log

Enable logging all payment gateway events. Recommended only for debugging purposes as this might save personal data.

### Payment provider selection

Choose whether you want the payment provider selection to happen on the checkout page or on a separate page.

### Merchant ID and Secret key

Your Paytrail credentials. You can obtain the keys by registering at our [website](https://www.paytrail.com) or contact [asiakaspalvelu@paytrail.com](mailto:asiakaspalvelu@paytrail.com) directly.

### Fallback Country

Setup fallback country to be used if no country is provided from Woocommerce checkout. Use only if billing_country/shipping_country is removed from checkout fields.

### Token migration ###

Choose this to update card information (tokens) from the old Checkout Finland for WooCommerce -plugin. The update is done upon saving settings.

###Exit intent wordpress popup

Exit intent popups work really well in retaining your visitors that are going to leave the website. They help remarkably in boosting your ecommerce conversion rate.

How does it work?

The exit intent technology tracks the mouse movements of your website visitors in order to detect exactly when a visitor is about to leave the website without fulfilling a conversion goal, i.e., signing up or buying a product. For mobile devices and tablets, the exit popup will show up when the visitor tries to click on the ‘back’ button to go back to the previous page. Exit intent popups not only help in capturing more leads but also keep the cart abandonment rate to a minimum.

Why exit popups work well is simply because when visitors decide to leave a website, they are confused about whether to go for the purchase or not sure about the next task.

>"Very happy: I was using the Kalviyo free version but wanted to try a different app as I did not want to spend $20 extra. Luckily while looking for apps, I found Automizely. Best thing about this app is there are many functions or apps in just one app. I use pop ups, free shipping headers, email flows, and newsletters. Very happy with the instant support system. Thank you so much for making this app."

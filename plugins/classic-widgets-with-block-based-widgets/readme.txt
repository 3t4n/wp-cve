Restore the classic widgets screen as a new menu item without replacing new block-based widgets.

== Description ==
*Classic Widgets with Block-based Widgets* allows you to use both widgets screens at the same time.
Sometimes, you need to use the classic widget screen for some of the widgets without permanently disabling the block-based widgets. With this plugin, you can access the Classic Widgets screen in `Appearance > Classic Widgets` and the block-based screen at the usual place in `Appearance > Widgets`.

**NOTE:-**
This plugin uses WordPress filters to create a new classic widget screen. That means it will work as long as WordPress supports the Classic Widgets screen.

<p>Quickly deactivate and archive a plugin for later review. Archiving a plugin both deactivates and removes the plugin from your visible Plugins list.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you create this plugin?</strong></p>
<p>In my day to day work cleaning malware from hacked websites, I sometimes run into situations where after updating WordPress, a plugin would break the website (causing a white screen or error message).</p>
<p>This has left me with a predicament. In deactivating the plugin in question, the plugin itself remained activatable within the plugins list.</p>
<p>Invariably, another administrator would log in a week or so later, see the plugin deactivated and "activate" it. This would often result in an emergency–and sadly, lots of finger pointing.</p>
<p>So The Hack Repair Guy's Plugin Archiver plugin was born.</p>

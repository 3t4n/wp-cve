msgid ""
"This plugin will not affect image display at your site until you have added "
"category images."
msgstr ""

#: settings.php:346
msgid ""
"Under the default settings, once you have designated category images, if "
"there is a post thumbnail or featured image available, it will be used. If "
"none has been set, the plug-in will use a category image if available. "
"Category images will also be used wherever they are independently enabled in "
"your theme - typically in category archive headings."
msgstr ""

#: settings.php:348
msgid ""
"If no specific category image has been set, Category Featured Images "
"Extended will look for an image from a parent category."
msgstr ""

#: settings.php:350
msgid ""
"The plug-in provides two additional options, which can be used together: "
"First, you can name one or more categories that will be excluded from the "
"fallback process: This feature will be helpful when you have not set unique "
"category images for all of the categories in use at your site, and when "
"posts are tending to fall back to a general category rather than to "
"relatively more specific ones."
msgstr ""

#: settings.php:352
msgid ""
"The second option is to set a specific category image as the site-wide "
"fallback, or thumbnail of last resort. You can name a category here that you "
"have also included among the excluded categories: The effect will be the "
"equivalent of saying \"Always use a specific other category if available, "
"but go ahead and use this one if there's no alternative."

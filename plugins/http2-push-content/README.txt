<blockquote>
Mobile and Desktop detection works based on the wp_is_mobile() function of the WordPress that detect device based on the user agent date send in the request
</blockquote>

Apart from this it also offer ability to remove Css and JS file from specific pages based in the selected page tag conditions 

Eg: if css path is https://s.w.org/style/wp4.css

then you can match it with wp4.css or style/wp4.css or s.w.org/style/wp4.css

you use 2nd method (style/wp4.css) for more precise selection (this avoid error when there are 2 style with same file name)

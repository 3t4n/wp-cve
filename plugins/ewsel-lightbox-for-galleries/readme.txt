Makes the WordPress galleries use a lightbox script called ColorBox to display the fullsize images.

== Description ==

Makes the native WordPress galleries use a lightbox script called [ColorBox](http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) to display the fullsize images right there in the page. No modifications required.

You can also make single non-`[gallery]` images use the lightbox by giving their links a class of "lightbox", like so:

`<a href="http://domian.com" class="lightbox"><img src="../img.jpg" alt="Demo" /></a>`

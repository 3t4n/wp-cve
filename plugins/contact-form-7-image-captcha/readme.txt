Adds an Image CAPTCHA to Contact Form 7 and WPForms, GDPR ready, perfect WPForms or Contact Form 7 Spam Protection Image CAPTCHA, adds a honeypot

== Description ==

Add an SVG image captcha and honeypot to your Contact Form 7 or WPForms form. Based on our interpretation this CAPTCHA plugin is GDPR compliant because the images are inline SVGs and no download of external resources happens, in addition no cookies or other storing mechanisms are used on the user's device, this plugin will not slow down your site with additional header requests like Google's ReCAPTCHA and respects your users privacy.

= Directions [PLEASE READ] =
Contact Form 7:
Add the shortcode [cf7ic] to the form editor where you want the CAPTCHA to appear.

You can hide the CAPTCHA until a user interacts with the form, by adding "toggle" to the shortcode: [cf7ic "toggle"]

WPForms:
Just activate the CAPTCHA for WPForms on the plugin's settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Language issues? =

If either only parts of the CAPTCHA text is translated, or everything is displayed in English, please read through the following possible causes and how to fix them.

**1 Translation missing**
All plugins within the wordpress.org repository are translated by the translate.wordpress.org community.
Maybe your language set is not fully translated or not translated at all, see:
https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/contact-form-7-image-captcha/

*In this case, you have the following options:*
1. Contribute to the translate.wordpress.org community and translate your language
2. Use another plugin to create your own local translation
3. Purchase the WP Image CAPTCHA PRO plugin which offers the possibility to choose your own messages without relying on any external translation - <a href="https://wpimagecaptcha.com/downloads/pro-plugin/?utm_source=wp_readme&utm_medium=wp_readme&wp_campaign=readme" target="_blank">Go Pro!</a>

**2 Update WordPress translations**
You might face the situation that your language pack is completely translated on translate.wordpress.org but the translation still might not work as expected.

*In this case, you have the following options:*
1. Update your language packs via: WP Admin > Dashboard > Updates > Translations > Update Translations

**3 Contact Form 7 language settings**
Contact Form 7 saves a meta variable for the language of each respective form and this is being done when you FIRST save the form. 

*In this case, you have the following options:*
1. Change the variable via the WordPress database directly (look for the post ID of the respective form in the postmeta table and there’ll be a “_locale” option).
2. Make sure to change the language in your WordPress backend to your desired target language and then simply re-create the CF7 form.

= How do you add the image CAPTCHA to the Contact Form 7 forms? =

Simply add this shortcode [cf7ic] to your contact form.

= How do you use the toggle feature for Contact Form 7? =

To make it so the CAPTCHA only shows when the form is being filled out, add "toggle" to the shortcode `[cf7ic "toggle"]` in your contact form.

= Toggle for Contact Form 7 is not working =

The most likely reason the toggle is not working is because the double quotes around the word toggle has been changed to "smart quotes", meaning that they are opening and closing quotation marks and not the verticle lines.

To fix, simply delete the quotes and re-add them with your keyboard - do not copy and paste.

= Why does the image CAPTCHA not appear? =

If the Image CAPTCHA does not appear, please confirm that you are running PHP version 7 or higher.

= Why does the styling of the image CAPTCHA look wrong? =

If the styling does not look right, you may need to clear your browser cache. If you have any caching plugins or speed optimization plugins installed, you may need to clear your site cache as well.

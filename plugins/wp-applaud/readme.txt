WP Applaud adds a Medium-like clap feature on your blog posts. Makes it easy for readers to appreciate the content they like.
 
== Description ==

Hey there!

Do you have blogger-brain? We do. We think a lot about our content. We wonder how well it’s doing, what our readers have to say, is it good enough. But, instead of struggling with analytics, we wanted a simple way of tracking our content’s performance. And what better way to do that then a simple, social-media-like feature to get the job done!

Lo, and behold, - the WordPress Applaud plugin - **WP Applaud**

Our simple plugin adds a cool “clap” feature on your WordPress blog. (Just like Medium)

For every article, a reader can *clap* to show their appreciation towards the post. The more the claps, the more they like a post. Think of it as an upvote, a like, or a heart, shown —simply, elegantly, and professionally—  as a clap. 

Make your blog more interactive, get instant feedback about your posts, with the awesome WP Applaud plugin.

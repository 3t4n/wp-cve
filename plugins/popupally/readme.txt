PopupAlly allows you to create advanced popup signup forms in under 5 minutes without dealing with messy code.

== Description ==
If you're looking to grow your list, then PopupAlly is the no-fluff free WordPress popup plugin for you. With built-in advanced features this lightbox popup plugin allows you to build your list as people are about to exit your website. 

Exit-intent popups allow you to capture lost visitors and have been shown to increase conversion by over 300%. [PopupAlly](https://popupally.com) allows you to create advanced popup signup forms in under 5 minutes, even if you don't know code. PopupAlly's visual editor allows you to customize the look-and-feel of your popups with an instant preview, saving you lots of time.

Beyond popups, with PopupAlly you can also design an optin box that's embedded anywhere on your site like in your sidebar, below your blog posts, or under your header as a horizontal opt-in.

> **Premium Support**
> The AccessAlly Team does not monitor the WordPress.org forums for the free popup plugin, but you'll find our [extensive tutorials](https://kb.accessally.com/tutorials/whats-the-difference-between-popupally-pro-and-the-free-version/) will help you get started fast!
>
> Hands-on concierge email support is available to [PopupAlly Pro plugin](https://popupally.com?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&utm_medium=banner&utm_content=main&utm_campaign=popupallypro) customers.
>
> [Click here](https://popupally.com/upgrading-to-popupally-pro/?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&utm_medium=banner&utm_content=main&utm_campaign=popupallypro) to see why we created the [premium version](https://popupally.com/upgrading-to-popupally-pro/?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&utm_medium=banner&utm_content=main&utm_campaign=popupallypro) with all of the extra feature requests we received! It's even more intuitive and quick to design beautiful drag-and-drop customized popups and multiple types of embedded opt-ins, too. It's well worth your investment!

= How PopupAlly Can Help You Build Your List Faster =

Let's take a look at the different features that make PopupAlly worth adding to your site... and the many ways that this free popup and optin box plugin can help you build a strong subscriber base.

= Mobile Friendly Popups and Opt-in Forms =

PopupAlly and PopupAlly Pro are both mobile responsive, which means that you don't have to worry about bad user experience for those on tablets or mobile phones. With PopupAlly, each template comes in 3 sizes that are easily tweaked to look good on smaller screens.

With [PopupAlly Pro](https://popupally.com?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&utm_medium=banner&utm_content=main&utm_campaign=popupallypro), you can add an unlimited number of screen sizes, so if you wanted to show a totally different opt-in form or popup on a different device - you could do that!

= Horizontal Opt-In Forms =

Ever wanted to have a horizontal optin form across the top, bottom, or below the navigation section on your WordPress website? Now you can! With PopupAlly you can use the horizontal optin box template and have people joining your list without taking up a ton of real estate on your site.

Plus, PopupAlly is compatible with any theme - so it will look good and fit with your existing set up.

= Time Delay and Exit-Intent Popups =

Not sure about using a popup on your site? With PopupAlly, you can choose when a popup appears... whether it's after a certain amount of time of your site, or right before someone is about to leave. 

The exit intentionality feature is extremely effective, because it doesn't interrupt your readers and visitors but it helps you capture their attention and their email address, before it's too late!

> **Why PopupAlly Should Be The Popup Plugin You Choose**
> "PopupAlly should be THE popup that people install. It's so much nicer and less intrusive than all of the other popups I've seen... even on big name sites. They should totally have PopupAlly instead of the one they have!" - Davina Fear

= Why You Should Consider Upgrading to PopupAlly Pro =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many popups can I have? =
You can configure 2 popups without upgrading to the Pro version. These can be embedded opt-ins or used as popups. Find out what else [you get when you upgrade to PopupAlly Pro](https://accessally.com/upgrading-to-popupally-pro/?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&utm_medium=banner&utm_content=main&utm_campaign=popupallypro). 

= Where does the subscriber information go after they click the submit button? =
You need an email marketing system before you can use PopupAlly. PopupAlly helps you create sign up forms that collect names and emails. Your email marketing automation platform stores the email addresses, and allows you to send a welcome sequence as well as regular newsletters to your subscribers. PopupAlly does not send emails directly to your subscribers.

If you don't have an email platform yet, here are some suggestions:

* [ConvertKit](https://accessally.com/aaconvertkit)
* [ActiveCampaign](https://accessally.com/active-campaign)
* [Drip](https://accessally.com/drip)
* [Infusionsoft](https://accessally.com/infusionsoft)
* [Ontraport](https://accessally.com/ontraport)
* [MailChimp](https://nathalielussier.com/mailchimp)
* [AWeber](https://nathalielussier.com/aweber)

Here is a tutorial video to help you integrate [MailChimp](http://nathalielussier.com/mailchimp) / [AWeber](http://nathalielussier.com/aweber) with PopupAlly.
[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xiX_BWTbU]

= Can I setup the popup for every post and page on my site? =
Absolutely! You can enable the popup for every post and page with 1 click on the display settings!

= Do I need to know how to modify HTML/CSS code? =
No programming experience required! You can see all the customizations instantly in the Visual Editor.

= Can I design mobile different responsive popups with PopupAlly? =
The free version of PopupAlly does not allow you to design different popups and opt-ins for mobile responsive devices, but [PopupAlly Pro does](https://popupally.com?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&utm_medium=banner&utm_content=main&utm_campaign=popupallypro). With the Pro version you can decide what to include or exclude from smaller devices, and whether or not to show popups on mobile devices. 

With the free version, there's a built-in look for mobile that is not customizable. 

Find out more about [Google's mobile popup policy here](https://popupally.com/blog/generate-more-leads/popups/google-anti-popup-mobile-policy/). 

= How do I put in my own sign up form? =
You just need to copy-and-paste in the HTML code from your CRM/list platform, and we will do the rest! No need to get your hands dirty with code.

= The popup was working, but it is not longer showing up even though I did not change anything! =
This is most likely due to the "Show popup every [x] days" option in Display Settings. Normally, you do not want to popup to show up every time a visitor comes to your website, so this option will stop the popup from showing up for [x] number of days. However, this makes testing difficult. The good news is that there are many ways to get around it. Please see the [tutorial](https://kb.accessally.com/tutorials/popupally-not-working-here-are-some-troubleshooting-tips/) for more details!

= I have done everything according to the tutorials, but the popup is not showing up! =
There are 3 main causes for this:
* With "Show for all pages?" checked in Display Settings, please make sure you do NOT check "All Pages" and "All Posts" under "Except for these posts/pages"
* Javascript errors will prevent popups from showing. With the page loaded, you can open the Developer View in Chrome and look for the red error sign. The error is usually caused by another plugin, so you can disable the active plugins one-by-one to see if that helps.

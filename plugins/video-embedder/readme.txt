Updates are comingâ€¦

This is a plugin for Wordpress that makes it easy to embed movies from various sources, such as YouTube and Google Video. The benefit with this plugin is that you don't have to paste some strange video embed code into your Wordpress post, all you need is the ID of the video. As a bonus none of the videos embedded with Video Embedder will break your precious validated Wordpress based site, all of the movies will show up nice and clean.

Another advantage is that you can manage the settings for all of your embedded movies from the Wordpress settings for Video Embedder, the properties for all the movies will be updated instantly as soon as you save the settings.

Have you changed the layout for your Wordpress blog? No sweat, Video Embedder makes it a breeze to change the dimensions of all your embedded videos no matter what service they are embedded from.

Are you using another Wordpress plugin for managing your YouTube movies or any of the other services that Video Embedder has support for today? Most likely it is very easy to make Video Embedder take care of those videos as well. Just edit the tag Video Embedder uses to match your old plugin and you are done.

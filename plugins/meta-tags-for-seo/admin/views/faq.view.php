                <p>Search engines such as Google use metadata from meta tags to understand additional information about the webpage. They can use this information for ranking purposes, to display snippets in search results. The most important thing to keep in mind when selecting or optimizing your meta keywords is to be sure that each keyword accurately reflects the content of your pages.<br /><br />Aside from the obviously important questions of number and relevance, when selecting your keywords, it&rsquo;s a good idea to bear in mind:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Common Misspellings:</strong> A best practice, including misspellings in your meta tags may indicate to search engines that your page is relevant to the (misspelled) search query, without your having to include the misspellings in your webpage copy.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Tail Keywords:</strong> Keyword variations and plurals are both useful to keep in mind, as well as the more extensive and more specific phrases known as long-tailed keywords.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Searches: </strong>The real search terms that brought users to your page in the past can be your best friend when creating lists of meta keywords. Check your analytics or log files to find those keywords, and use keyword tools to back up your data. What words do people tend naturally to use when describing your business? And what words are your competitors using?</li>
                </ul>

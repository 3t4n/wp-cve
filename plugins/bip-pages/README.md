# BIP Pages

A Wordpress plugin for easy creation of Polish public information bulletin (Biuletyn Informacji Publicznej, or BIP) websites by NGOs and institutions.

Available in Polish and in English.

The plugin adds a new type of page to your Wordpress installation, called a "BIP page".

In accordance with the Polish public information access act ([ustawa o dostÄ™pie do informacji publicznej](http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20011121198)), each BIP page displays the following information in its footer:
* the date of its creation,
* the date of its last modification,
* its author.

Additionally, the extension automatically creates a rudimentary editable main page for your BIP (containing all the information required by law), as well as a page with basic usage instructions (also required by law).

# Installation

We recommend installing directly from Wordpress' "Add new plugin" page in the admin panel or downloading from [the BIP Pages plugin page on Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bip-pages/).

This will get you the latest stable version of this plugin.

You can also download this repository into your Wordpress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory and activate the plugin in your admin panel.

Note: latest `master` **does not** necessarily contain stable and bug-free code. Use caution.

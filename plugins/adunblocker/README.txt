== Description ==

[AdUnblocker](https://digitalapps.com/wordpress-plugins/adunblocker/)  plugin detects if Google AdSense (or any other ad network) ads are not running on your site. Ads are usually blocked by ad-blockers (eg AdBlock, AdBlock Plus). A popup shows with a text requesting user to whitelist your website.

> For majority of users the AdUnblocker works without any issues. If you suspect that AdUnblocker doesn't work on your site, you might be targeted by your visitors, they might have requested a filter to be created specificly for your site. Reach out to me so we can find a solution for you. Contact me via my website [Digital Apps](https://digitalapps.com/contacts) or simply open a ticket here on WordPress.

If your ad network is not supported please reach out to us to be included.

> Important!
> 1. By default the plugin is ***not active***, after installation, tune your settings and ***click activate*** under AdUnblocker > Settings page
> 2. For the Admin UI to work correctly please ***disable your adblocker*** if you have one

Often elements get hidden behind another due to styling or positioning, this leaves you with no way to select or edit that element. With the navigation tree you can select any element at any time, as well as seeing a clearer view of the structure of your page.

The plugin currently has no options, when you activate it the plugin, you will notice a button to the right of your screen when in elementor mode. Click this to reveal/hide the list.

You can control the name of the element by using the Advanced > CSS ID field. Remember to use - or _ instead of spaces to make a-long-custom-name OR a_long_custom_name.

== Installation ==

Delete any old installations of the plugin. Extract the zip file and drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation. Activate the plugin from Plugins page.

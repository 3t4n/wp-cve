**************************************************************************************************
v. 0.9.7 of RS Event

	Mods by LivingOS:

	A modified version incorporating the WordPress 2.3 fixes from LivingOS and some of the 
	ideas from Nudnik i.e. preset this year on Write Post form & if no time is set, leave it 
	out plus some cosmetics. It does not include his change to 12 hour clock which I didn't 
	think was helpful.


	Mods by Rick Parsons:

	* reduced the excerpt size from 55 to 20 words because 55 is a bit long for a sidebar.
	* fixed a bug with timezoning in routine gmdate_i18n and another one in rs_event_list 
	  (right at the top).
	* modified the algorithm, so that today's events stay on the page right up to the very end. 
	  I have done this so that I can keep the caption "Services this Sunday" without it 
	  changing over to next week's morning service part way through the day.
	* changed the plugin registration and admin so that it works properly with WP2.7

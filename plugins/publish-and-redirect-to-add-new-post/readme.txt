Redirects to 'Add new post' page after 'save draft' or 'publish post' for faster adding mulitple posts.

== Description ==

By default when you add new post and hit 'publish' or 'save draft' button, wordpress redirects to 'post edit screen' of the same post, but this little plugin will help you go to add new post screen each time you add new post to help you keep adding multiple posts more faster.

update: added 3rd button for 'publish and visit now' to redirect to the post or page after publish. See the screenshots.

# CHL-Change HTML Lang
*CHL-Change HTML Lang is a simple and very lightweight WordPress SEO plugin for changing HTML language attribute value in the header.*

## Description

Many of us use WordPress(Admin area UI) in the English version but write their content in another language. So by default WordPress uses English(en-US) language attribute for `<?php language_attributes(); ?>` used in **header.php**.
For example - If you write your content in Hindi language but use WordPress(Admin area UI) in English, your html language attribute must be **hi** or **hi-IN** for many reasons including SEO but WordPress echo html language attribute of installed locale version (en-US by default).
You can't change HTML language attribute directly so I created this plugin(CHL-Change HTML Lang) that allows you to change HTML language attribute from the dashboard.
**After activating this plugin simply visit *Settings → General* and change HTML lang tag.**

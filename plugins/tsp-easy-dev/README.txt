== Frequently asked questions ==

= What is an Framework? =

A framework provides a method of building software applications. Easy Dev is a framework for WordPress plugin development. Developers can use our simple framework instead of learning how to interface directly with WordPress. Easy Dev's framework does all the hard work for you behind the scenes.

= How do I use the framework? Where do I begin? =

In our [documentation](https://lab.letaprodoit.com/public/wiki/wordpress-ed:MainPage), we have included real plugin examples that are using Easy Dev. Our [complete framework](https://lab.letaprodoit.com/docs/tsp-easy-dev/) is also available.

= I've installed the plugin but nothing happens. What did I do wrong? =

Nothing. The plugin runs in real-time behind the scenes. Once installed, there are no other steps to take. You use our plugin to build your own plugins.

== Screenshots ==

1. No need to learn WordPress plugin development, with Easy Dev, you only have to fill in your settings and display your HTML and with Smarty, skelJS and FontAwesome built into Easy Dev Pro it makes displaying your code a sinch!

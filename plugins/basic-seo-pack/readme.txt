Go to Basic SEO setting page at /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=bseop-options then fill the form with your main site keywords and description. If desired (and if your site hasn't been verified), you can insert webmaster (google, bing and alexa) verification code and google analytics for the better result. Click "Save Changes" button.

Everything was perfect require more hard work. We could just make the keywords and descriptions automatically drawn from categories and tags as well as from the title or excerpt, but I didn't do that because it would be better if we set by ourself.

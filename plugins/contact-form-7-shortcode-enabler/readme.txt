This plugin enables the usage of external schrtcodes inside Contact Form 7 Forms.

== Description ==
Many themes, as well as other plugins, provide shortcodes for layout options like multi-column-layouts, tabs, etc.

It only processes its own shortcodes used to generate form elements.

This plugin enables the usage of external shortcodes inside Contact Form 7 Forms.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the entire cf7-enable-shortcode folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

The Plugin requires no additional configuration.

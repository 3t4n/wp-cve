SoundCloud Shortcode plugin for WordPress

== Description ==

This plugin converts all SoundCloud shortcodes into embeddable SoundCloud players. It works for any SoundCloud track, playlist, user, or group. Once you install this plugin, it will work for any of your WordPress posts & pages. I mean, *sure* you could use oEmbed or the snappy new Gutenberg editor to simply paste in a SoundCloud URL; but we like to keep things *old-school* ðŸ˜Ž

A simple example:

`[soundcloud]http://soundcloud.com/forss/flickermood[/soundcloud]`

**More Options**

SoundCloud Shortcodes support these optional parameters:

* `width`
* `height`
* `params`

The `params` parameter passes additional options to the SoundCloud embeddable player. You can find a full list on the SoundCloud Developers pages: https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/html5-widget

An example of a track that starts playing automatically, with hot-pink controls:

`[soundcloud params="auto_play=true&color=#F368E0"]http://soundcloud.com/forss/flickermood[/soundcloud]`

== Installation ==

1. Upload `soundcloud-shortcode` to your plugins directory or install it from the WordPress Plugin Repository
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

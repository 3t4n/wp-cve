= Idea Behind =
Today, if your website loads slow, there is no need to even bother with any other optimization at all. 

Page load time is one of Google’s top priorities for 2020 and it’s also its ranking signal. <strong>If Google’s crawler can't access your website because it's loading slow or throwing errors, it will never proceed further with indexation and ranking</strong>, and as a result, your website won't get any decent organic traffic.

I wanted an easy-to-use tool to warn me in case my website load time may harm it’s search rankings. I wanted a native WordPress solution, with all information available from the dashboard, simple but still informative, a guard who will do the monitoring every day and ping me, in case something goes wrong. 
I have not found one and that's why I've built this plugin. 

I'll be happy to know that you find it useful as well, feel free to leave a review :)

== Screenshots ==
1. HomePage is tested on activation
2. Add pages you want to test
3. View PageSpeed Insights reports
4. Choose Mobile or Desktop
5. Choose when you would like to get notified

== Installation ==
= Automatic plugin installation: =
1. Go to Plugins > Add New in your WordPress Admin
2. Search for SpeedGuard plugin
3. Click Install SpeedGuard
4. Activate SpeedGuard after installation
5. Follow further instructions to add pages that you want to test


= Configuration: =
Go to the SpeedGuard -> Settings page to set the scan frequency and whether you prefer to be emailed. 

For example, you can set tests to run every day and send you a performance report every day, too. 

Or you may want to receive an email just in case the average site speed is worse than say, 5 seconds (adjustable too). 
In this case, the plugin will perform tests every day but only send you the warning if your site is loading slower than the time you have set.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How tests are performed? =
Starting from version 1.7 SpeedGuard is using [Google PageSpeed Insights API](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) which uses [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) technology to perform tests. 

= Do I need Google PageSpeed Insights API key to use SpeedGuard? =
No, you don't. Just add pages you need to test. 

= Are the speed results for desktop or mobile users? =
You can choose the type of device to emulate:
* Desktop
* Mobile

= Is it compatible with WordPress Multisite? =
It is! Use per-site activation.

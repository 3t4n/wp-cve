When activated, disables automatic parsing and creation of clickable links in
comments, including http, ftp, and e-mail links.  Links can still be added using
HTML tags, if allowed.  Requires WordPress 1.5 or later.

== Description ==

This simple plugin disables the automatic parsing of links in comments on your
blog.  Ordinarily, if a user types something like http://www.google.com/, it
will automatically be turned into a clickable link when it is displayed.  This
plugin disables this behavior for http, ftp, and e-mail links.

Note that comments can include the HTML tags necessary to create links, if you
allow HTML in comments, and these links will not be removed.  This also allows
you as the administrator to get around the "no comments in links" rule enforced
by this plugin, since administrators (and editors) by default can post comments
with unfiltered HTML.

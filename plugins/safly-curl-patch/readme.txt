Thrid party service we use:
We use free Http DNS service of Tencent company to resolve domain more accurately and avoid domain hijacking, and we just send the domain to 119.29.29.29 and fetch the resolve result. We respect your privacy and you can clearly figure out how the function SCP_Gethostbyname which is involved in the third party service works via its source code.

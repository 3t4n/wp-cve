= I do not see a confirmation notice when the download is completed = 

You will not see a confirmation notice as we are writing a download file and the 
headers have already been sent.  You will notice when you export from the WordPress 
tools you will not see a confirmation notice.  It is best to look at your browser's 
downloads progress information or look in your downloads folder on your computer.

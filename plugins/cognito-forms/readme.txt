**[Data Collection](https://www.cognitoforms.com/product/data-collection?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=profile)**

Format numbers for calculations, dates and times, add values to dropdowns and checkboxes, capture electronic signatures, and collect file uploads using our drag-and-drop form builder.

**[Data Management](https://www.cognitoforms.com/product/data-management?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=profile)**

Creating your form and sharing it with your customers is just step one – what happens to all that data after it gets submitted? In Cognito Forms, you can sort through and filter down your entries, create customized data sets, and perform multiple tasks at once.

**[Integrations](https://www.cognitoforms.com/product/integrations?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=profile)**

Use Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate or Make to exchange data with thousands of applications. Create workflows and automatically trigger tasks directly from your form entries. And quickly set it all up using either no-code visual interfaces or JSON.

**[Logic & Automation](https://www.cognitoforms.com/product/logic-automation?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=profile)**

Set form behaviors and automate tasks using our visual conditional logic. Easily add text piping to make your forms more conversational. Or, enable actions that conditionally send notifications, include file attachments, perform calculations, or set limits in quantities and dates – all using our no-code/low-code visual interface.

**[Security & Compliance](https://www.cognitoforms.com/product/security-compliance?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=profile)**

Quickly create additional protections for fields and forms. Set organizational controls by the individual form or folder. Manage access and account permissions. And stay compliant with HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA and other security regulations.

**[Online Payment](https://www.cognitoforms.com/product/online-payment?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=profile)**

Accept online payments directly through your forms – using Square, Stripe or PayPal. Whether you’re collecting a simple online donation or processing complex multi-variable transactions, you can do so easily on any of our plan levels.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Cognito Forms cloud-hosted? =

Cognito Forms is a subscription-based service and we host all of the forms and data collected securely on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, which is PCI (DSS) Level 1 and HIPAA compliant.

= How do I create a form? =

Getting started with Cognito Forms is easy. Just [sign up for a free account](https://www.cognitoforms.com/signup?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=profile), then choose "New Form" to create your first form. 

Once you're done designing your form, you can embed it onto a post or a page using the Cognito Forms block. Just add a "Cognito Forms" block to your post or page, select the form you'd like to embed, and publish your changes to see your form in action.

= Now that I've built a form, can I receive a notification every time my form is submitted? =

Yes – in fact, our forms default to sending an email notification to the email address belonging to the owner of the account.

You can further customize that email notification to be sent on behalf of your website domain, contain custom content, show details from the entry, or go to multiple email addresses.

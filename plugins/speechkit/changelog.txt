    * We’ve added a “BeyondWords” tab into the Elementor [Page Settings Panel](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/editor/page-settings-panel/).

= 3.9.1 =

Release date: 6th October 2022

**Compatible with WordPress 5.8 or greater**

* [WordPress core dropped support for IE in version 5.8](https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/dropping-support-for-internet-explorer-11/) released July 2021.
* The official [wp-scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/) package we use does not produce IE-friendly code, so we have adjusted our minimum supported WordPress version to 5.8.

**Enhancements**

* Hide audio controls for blocks if the post does not have audio.
* Partial source code linting (using `wp-scripts lint-js --fix`).

= 3.9.0 =

Release date: 22nd September 2022

**Enhancements**

* Added a "Remove" button into the Inspect panel to clear BeyondWords data for individual posts.
* Delete audio data in BeyondWords API when a post is trashed or deleted in WordPress. Restoring the post in WordPress will restore the audio data in BeyondWords.

**Fixes**

* Add the missing `beyondwordsAudio` block attribute for server-rendered blocks. Thanks for the report and fix, @hughiemolloy! 🙌
* Don't register the `_speechkit_disable_generate_audio` custom field. This plugin v2.x field has not been used in a while, so there is no need to register it.

**Continuous Integration**

* The Docker config for local development now closely matches our CI config – they now both use [WP CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) to download and install WordPress.
* Improvements to our [CodeCeption](https://codeception.com/) test suites to fix an intermittent MySQL error.

= 3.8.1 =

Release date: 25th August 2022

= 3.8.0 =

Release date: 25th August 2022

**Code Refactoring**

* Refactor the `Core\PostUtils` class into `Core\PostContentUtils` and `Core\PostMetaUtils` to reduce class complexity.

= 3.7.1 =

Release date: 12th August 2022

**Fixes**

* Remove the "X BeyondWords errors" notice on the Posts screen to fix a reported slow MySQL query. We are working on a long-term fix for this problem. In the meantime, individual error messages are still available to view in the BeyondWords column (Posts screen) and BeyondWords panel (Post Edit screen).

= 3.7.0 =

Release date: 11th August 2022

**Important developer notice**

* In this update our plugin instance has been renamed from `$speechkit_wordpress_plugin` to `$beyondwords_wordpress_plugin`.
* Please do not access the plugin instance directly in your code. The objects and methods it contains are intended for internal use, and over time they are likely to change.
* Instead, use the [documented WordPress filters](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs/integrations/wordpress/wordpress-filters) and contact our team via [hello@beyondwords.io](mailto:hello@beyondwords.io) if you need new actions or filters to achieve your goals.

**Enhancements**

* Automatically clear all `beyondwords_*` and `speechkit_*` data when the plugin is uninstalled.
* Add BeyondWords section to 'Tools' > 'Site Health'.
* 'Bulk actions' > 'Generate audio' now regenerates audio if it already exists (bulk processing previously "Skipped" posts which already had audio).
* Replace remaining instances of "SpeechKit" brand name with "BeyondWords".
    * There were still instances where the former brand name for BeyondWords was being used throughout the code - mostly in the names for custom fields and filters.
    * These have now all been updated, maintaining support for older posts with `speechkit_*` data.
* Improve "Pending review" support.
    * When a post is saved in WordPress we now send `{ published: true|false }` to the BeyondWords API.
    * This is primarily to prevent audio appearing in BeyondWords playlists for posts which are saved as "pending" in WordPress.

**Fixes**

* Add `isset()` checks for `$beyondwords_wordpress_plugin->player` to prevent PHP "Undefined property" errors.

= 3.6.1 =

Release date: 6th May 2022

**Fixes**

* When posts were saved using the WordPress Block Editor multiple BeyondWords API calls could be made. This resulted in the "Skipped" status for audio, and a fix for this has been added.
* Handle responses saved as object of class `WP_Error`. Older posts edited with v2.x of our plugin could have an unexpected `WP_Error` in a custom field. We now handle this, fixing a reported PHP error on the Post Edit screen.

= 3.6.0 =

Release date: 29th April 2022

**Enhancements**

* Expose BeyondWords data in GraphQL to support decoupled frontends. Post types which are supported by **both** BeyondWords and [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) have the following fields in GraphQL:
    * `beyondwords.podcastId`
    * `beyondwords.projectId`

**Code Coverage**

* Increased PHPUnit test coverage to 85%.

= 3.5.0 =

Release date: 20th April 2022

**Enhancements**

**Fixes**

**Code Refactoring**

* Refactor the `Core\Utils` class to improve PHPMD ExcessiveClassComplexity score.

= 3.4.0 =

* The audio player now uses a socket connection while in Classic Editor.

= 3.3.3 =

Release date: 17th March 2022

Release date: 7th February 2022

**Fixes**

* By default, remove `pending` from the list of post statuses we generate audio for.

**Enhancements**

* Audio players can now be positioned anywhere in the post content! Use the **BeyondWords** block for the default Block Editor, or the TinyMCE "**Insert BeyondWords player**" button for Classic Editor.
* Provide `speechkit_post_types` filter to customise the post types we generate audio for. Post types without `custom-fields` in the `supports` array will be removed from this list.
* Provide `speechkit_post_statuses` filter to customise the post statuses we generate audio for.

= 3.1.0 =

Release date: 5th January 2022

**Deprecations**

* Deprecated 3 legacy filters: `sk_the_content`, `sk_player_before` and `sk_player_after`.
    * Replace these filters with `speechkit_js_player_html` and `speechkit_amp_player_html`.
    * Using the deprecated filters in v3.x will log a `_doing_it_wrong()` error.
    * In v4.0 the legacy filters will be removed.

**Fixes**

* Replace `WP_PLUGIN_DIR` and `WP_PLUGIN_URL` constants with `plugin_dir_path()` and `plugin_dir_url()` to improve multisite support.

**Enhancements**

* Improve AMP plugin compatibility by removing all potential problems reported in the AMP Validation Error Index.
* New `speechkit_amp_player_html` filter to modify the HTML for the AMP audio player.
* New `speechkit_js_player_html` filter to modify the HTML for the standard JavaScript audio player.

Release date: 22nd Nov 2021

**BeyondWords is the new name for SpeechKit.**

* All user-facing instances of `SpeechKit` have been replaced with `BeyondWords`.
* For a smooth transition, behind-the-scenes we have retained the following for the time being:
    * **Filters**, **custom fields** and **plugin options** are still prefixed as `speechkit_*`
    * DOM IDs and class names are still `speechkit-*`.
    * The plugin slug and text-domain are still `speechkit`
    * Requests to BeyondWords services are still made to speechkit.io domains.
* The complete transition to `beyondwords` and beyondwords.io domains will happen in the near future.

    2. If the player has been disabled
    3. Any processing errors
* Extra fields have been added to the Inspect panel in the SpeechKit sidebar.

* To improve stability and security, we no longer attempt to send data from SpeechKit to your WordPress site. We only send data from your site to SpeechKit.

**Deprecations**

* The iFrame player has been replaced by the JavaScript SDK, with the exception of the AMP player which still uses iFrame.
* The "SpeechKit Status" column on the Posts screen no longer displays the processing status. The processing status is now shown in the JavaScript SDK player of the WordPress admin screens.

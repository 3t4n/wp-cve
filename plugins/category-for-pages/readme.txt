== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do the Post Tags sections for posts and pages in the Admin Menu show the same tag count? =

The reason for that is that WordPress combines the number of occurrences of tags used in posts and pages in the taxonomy `post_tag`. Though, if you click on the number of a certain tag, WordPress will only show the related posts or pages of the selected tag.

= Why do the Post Categories sections for posts and pages in the Admin Menu show the same category count? =

For the same reason above. The only difference is that it uses the taxonomy `category`.

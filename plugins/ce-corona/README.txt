== Description ==
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
According to WHO( World Health Organization ), This disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.

This plugin displays the Coronavirus ( Covid19 ) case data of the whole world and country you care through a shortcode [ce_corona] in your WordPress post or page. You can use this shortcode with some attributes also. For example: [ce_corona data_table=true now=true compareCountry=true]. If data_table is set to false, now and 'compareCountry' will be false automatically.

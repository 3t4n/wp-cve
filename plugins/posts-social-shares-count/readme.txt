= How to use =
To count for example how many times the post or page has been shared on Facebook use the function echo pssc_facebook() in the loop or echo pssc_facebook( $post_id ) anywhere. This function will return the count integer for example 5 or 0.

Or you can use the shortcode [pssc_facebook] in the post you want to count shares for or [pssc_facebook post_id=""] for a specific post by ID.

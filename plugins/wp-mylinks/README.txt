== Description ==

### Build a fully customizable micro landing page for your business and personal brand.

WP MyLinks can help you create a micro landing page that contains all the links you want to share to your audience with the tool you're currently using and the domain name that reflects your own brand.

Your most favorite social media usually limits you from showing multiple links on your profile. And you're forced to use third party services. 

#### Worry no more! 
Now, you can build your own landing page to market your content, brand, products and anything under a single URL with the tool and resource you currently have.

#### Don't lose your precious traffics!
Put the generated link on your external channels such as social media profiles and drive 100% traffics to your micro landing page.

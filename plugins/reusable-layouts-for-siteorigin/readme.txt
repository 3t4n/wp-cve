Create SiteOrigin layouts you build once and reuse anywhere. Includes a dedicated widget to easily display a layout on the front-end.

== Description ==

Reusable Layouts add a flexible additional system to the SiteOrigin Page Builder framework. They provide an area in the WordPress administration to store and organise layouts along with a dedicated widget for displaying the content anywhere on your website. If you update the content in the reusable layout it will update in all areas you have it displayed.

A quick and simply way to reuse your content in multiple locations across your website. 

The plugin registers a new post type 'Reusable Layouts' under Appearance > Reusable Layouts. Build these layouts with SiteOrigin. Display anywhere on your site with the Render Layout widget. Reusable Layouts for SiteOrigin are great for a build it once option or to break large pages down into smaller chunks to lighten the load on the server (especially when saving).

== Installation ==
Install from WP > Admin > Plugins

Render the layout anywhere with a the Render Layout widget

== Description ==

AI preloader is a tool that displays an animation or loading screen while a website's content is being loaded. This loading animation or screen can give visitors the impression that the website is actively loading and prevent them from leaving the website due to a slow loading speed.

The preloader plugin works by detecting when the website is being loaded and displaying the animation or screen until the entire website content is fully loaded. This can help improve user experience by reducing the frustration and annoyance caused by long load times.

In addition to the basic function of displaying a loading animation, many preloader plugins offer additional customization options such as selecting the animation style or adding a logo or custom message to the loading screen.

Overall, AI Preloader WordPress plugin can help improve the user experience of your website by providing a visually appealing loading animation or screen while the content is being loaded, making the site seem more professional and engaging.

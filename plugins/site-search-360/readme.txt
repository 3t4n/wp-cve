## Features

* Fast indexing and swift search and suggestions

* Drop-in replacement: in most cases you do not need to change a single configuration to enable the search instantly.
* Fast typeahead autocomplete search suggestions based on titles, tags, and author names.
* Custom taxonomy indexing: custom taxonomy terms can be indexed and even shown in the search results.
* Search results **automatically update** when you save, delete, or change search content.
* Easily customizable by CSS and the [dashboard](https://app.sitesearch360.com/).
* Site Search 360 [Search designer](https://www.sitesearch360.com/search-designer) compatible.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### My theme doesn't have a search box, how do I add one? ###

You can add a search box to your site by using one of the following options:

* In your WordPress administration go to **Appearance > Widgets** and add **Site Search 360 Search Form** widget to your widget area.
* Use shortcodes to add search box to your posts or pages, you can add a search box by using the `[ss360-searchbox]` shortcode, a search button by using the `[ss360-searchbutton]Search[/ss360-searchbutton]` shortcode or a full search form by using the `[ss360-form][ss360-searchbox][ss360-searchbutton]Search[/ss360-searchbutton][/form]` shortcode (**recommended**).
* Add a search box by modifying your theme files. See our [Wordpress Integration Guide](https://docs.sitesearch360.com/wordpress-integration) for more details. **Please Note:** Only modify the theme files if you know what you're doing and if the theme license allows modification.

### How can I index ACFs (Advanced Custom Fields)? ###

To index custom fields with Site Search 360 go to your WordPress administration and under **Site Search 360 > Indexing** you can select which custom fields should be indexed.

* Each **text field** can be used as the search result title, search result snippet, or added to the content to improve the search results.

* **Image field** can be used as the search result preview image.

If you need more flexibility when indexing custom fields, you can select the *Crawler indexing* option and customize the indexing behavior in the [Site Search 360 Control panel](https://app.sitesearch360.com).

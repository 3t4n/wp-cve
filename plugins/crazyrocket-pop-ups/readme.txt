####How does a gamified popup work?####

As a merchant, you need to deliver a compelling shopping experience to establish trust and persuade visitors to buy from your shop.

Interactive popups help to break the ice, engage users and entice them to complete the purchase because:

* Gamification (like fortune wheel) spark curiosity and challenge users to take action

* Winning a prize creates a sense of achievement

* Having a coupon infuses desire to spend it... nobody wants to miss out a deal :)


####Three Amazing Popup Games####

* **WHEEL** - The high-converting wheel of fortune.

* **SLOT** - The most iconic game ever. Who doesn't love slot machines?

* **SCRATCH 'N' WIN** - Scratch cards... simple yet effective!


####Beautiful, highly customizable themes####

Build your popup in no time with our ready-to-use wheel, slot and scratch card themes.

Customize text, wheel slices, logo, background, font, buttons, and even CSS with our effective “What You See Is What You Get” editor.

Save your themes on the Template Library and reuse them to launch your next campaign!


####Customizable Rewards####

Easily select and assign discount codes to campaigns from WooCommerce and set the probability (weight) for each discount.
Set each of the wheel’s slices separately. 

####Launch icon####

Let users click an icon to launch the popup: there are six different icons you can place in six positions. Of course, you can also upload your own!

####Popup Triggers####

Triggers allow you to define when and how users must be engaged by the popup.

* Leave intent: show the popup when users move the mouse outside of the screen
* Time: show the popup after a defined period
* Page views: show the popup if the user visits at least x pages
* Scroll: display the popup if the user scrolls the page by x %

####Behavior-driven Notifications####

Worried that popups could be too aggressive for your audience?
Use a small notification at the bottom of the screen instead: users will click it to open the wheel.

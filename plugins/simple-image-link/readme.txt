So you want to put an ad or an image in your sidebar. And you want it to link to another site. And you want to do it easily, without having to muck about with the code in the text widget.

Simple Image Link lets you easily add images to your sidebar, be they advertisements, buttons of support or buttons of protest without the need for any HTML.

It even displays its name in the widget header within the dashboard allowing you to easily see which simple image link widget is which.

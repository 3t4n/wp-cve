Some user ID's can be specified as well. You just to need to input some coma-separated user ID's who can see the content.

You can set a custom text to be displayed when a content is rescricted and the visitor is not allowed to access it. With the native text editor, you can decide how you want the text to look.

#### 🎉 Show a *Section* template
Alternatively, a custom template can be used. You just need to create a **Section** template from the Elementor -> Templates section.

It allows you to completely hide your content and not to show an alternate text or template.
